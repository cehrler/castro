This report presents \emph{History Explorer}: a graphical tool for document retrieval and navigation in databases of historical documents. 
We use similarity measurements according to historically motivated types of extracted information in order to suggest potential similarity, relatedness and other links between documents of a historical collection. Our system provides advanced functionalities for querying the database and presents the outcome of the query as an interactive graph in which nodes represent documents and edges represent degree of predicted association between documents. The graph is adjustable for various specifications with historical and linguistic interpretations and accompanied by a set of features that support flexible and informative exploration of the collection. The overall design of the tool aims at helping historians to browse through historical collections and increasing their chances of discovering information that is relevant for their research interests.
