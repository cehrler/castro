\note{Evaluation 
of sub-components and system overall (insofar as it makes sense) 
either quantitative (e.g., accuracy for information extraction 
task) 
and/or qualitative (e.g., give examples where your system

also discuss cases where your system doesnâ€™t perform well and 
describe how it could be improved (error analysis)}
