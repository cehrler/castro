	\subsection{General Description}
	\note a system for powerful search and navigation through a collection of historical documents.
	
	\subsection{Subtasks}
 	\note processing steps and system components

	\subsection {NLP Motivation}
	\note application of existing tools and development of new tools and techniques for processing historical data.
	
	\subsection{Historic Motivation}
		\subsubsection{Working with Collections of Historic Documents}
 		\note what is difficult about it, why existing tools are limited 
 					why our approach is useful:
 					relevance of metadata, NE's, graphical representation, etc for finding documents that suit the interest of the 
 					historian.
		\subsubsection{Case Study: Fidel Castro}
 		\note Introduction, importance and particularities of Castro's speeches
