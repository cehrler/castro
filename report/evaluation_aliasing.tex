As mentioned in the introduction, true CR in a traditional sense was foregone in the beginning of the project in favour of a string kernel-based approach \note{CITATION NEEDED}. Similarly to CRR, the string kernel-based similarity measure allowed many permutations of a similar named entity to be correlated (e.g.\ \textbf{\lingform{Castro}} $\rightarrow$ \{\lingform{Fidel Castro}, \lingform{Dr. Fidel}, \lingform{DrFidel} \ldots\}). However, the the string kernel method as it is currently implemented overgenerates such similarities--- for example, \textbf{\lingform{State Technical University}} $\rightarrow$ \{\lingform{Socialist Youth}, \lingform{API}, \lingform{Socialist Party}, \lingform{State Committee}, \lingform{forTechnical}, \lingform{Catholicism} \ldots\}.

In effect, the string kernel method often associates unrelated NEs, unrelated documents are erroneously related with each other, causing recall to be relatively high in comparison to the precision obtained through the method. This in turn causes a large amount of noise in the graph, making it harder for the user to discern relationships between documents which may be useful to the user.
