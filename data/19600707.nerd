FOLLOWING IS RUNNING ACCOUNT OF SPEECH OF FIDEL CASTRO WHICH STARTED AT 12
MIDNIGHT, AT CLOSING SESSION OF METALLURGICAL WORKERS CONGRESS:

CONGRESS HELD AT MOMENT OF GREAT TRANSCENDENCY FOR COUNTRY.  NOTHING
TEACHES PEOPLE REALITIES FASTER THAN A REVOLUTION, THAN CLASH OF INTERESTS
BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL.  REVOLUTIONS ARE NOTHING BUT STRUGGLE
BETWEEN PEOPLE AND INTERESTS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE.  NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THIS
STRUGGLE WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT.  THIS TYPE OF STRUGGLE SHOWS WHAT
PEOPLE MADE OF:  HONOR, LOYALTY, COURAGE, DEVOTION OR TREASON,
SHAMELESSNESS, COWARDICE, HYPOCRISY.  REVOLUTION MAKES EVERYONE TAKE OFF
THEIR MASK.  REVOLUTION ALSO REVEALS LIES ON NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
FRONT; WHAT CREATED INTERESTS ARE; WHO SERVE THOSE INTERESTS; WHO ARE TRUE
PATRIOTS; WHO ARE TRAITORS WHO SELL THEMSELVES TO FOREIGN GOLD.

HE WHO FOR YEARS RECEIVED LEAST IS ONE MOST LOYAL TO REVOLUTION:  EXPLOITED
WORKER, DISCRIMINATED NEGRO, NEGLECTED FARMER, ETC. NEITHER BETRAYALS OR
AGGRESSIONS WILL CHANGE THIS DEVOTION OF THE PEOPLE.  BETRAYALS WILL
CONTINUE.  TRAITORS HAVE BEEN DROPPING AWAY FROM REVOLUTION WITH PASSAGE OF
EACH LAW.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE WITNESSED PARADE OF DESERTERS.  THIS
REVOLUTION IS GETTING TOO HOT FOR SOME PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CANNOT
GET AWAY FROM HABIT OF FOREIGN YOKE ON THEIR NECKS.  THEY GET SO SCARED
THAT THEY SAY "I AM LEAVING".  THEY REACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN BORN IN CUBA
BY MISTAKE.  THEY ARE ALL LINKED WITH WAR CRIMINALS, DISCREDITED GROUPS WHO
ALL HAVE SAME MASTER - STATE DEPARTMENT.  THEY ARE SO SHAMELESS THEY FORGET
THERE IS THING WORSE THAN BEING BATISTIANO - THAT IS TO SERVE TRAITOROUSLY
A FOREIGN MASTER WHO EXPLOITS YOUR COUNTRY.

THEY ARE ALL A BAND OF WOLVES READY TO DEVOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.  THEY HAVE
PINNED THEIR HOPES ON VESTED INTERESTS AND SOLDIERS OF FOREIGN HIERARCHY
WHICH CONTROLLED OUR COUNTRY.  BUT THIS IS FUTILE HOPE, FOR PEOPLE WILL
DEFEND REVOLUTION WITH "UNBELIEVABLE HEROISM".  WE KNOW WHAT WE MUST DO TO
CONSOLIDATE REVOLUTION.  WE KNOW WHO TRAITORS ARE AND WHY THEY ARE AGAINST
REVOLUTION POOR, HUMBLE, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED ARE ON SIDE OF
REVOLUTION.  THIS IS END OF EXPLOITERS, POWERFUL INTERESTS IN OUR COUNTRY
AND BEGINNING OF END FOR THEM IN WORLD AT LARGE.

NOTHING SURPRISES US - NEITHER TREASON NOR AGGRESSION.  THOSE WITH RIGHT ON
THEIR SIDE ALWAYS WIN.

THOSE WHO THOUGHT THAT JANUARY 1, 1959 MARKED END OF STRUGGLE DID NOT
UNDERSTAND THAT FIGHT STILL AHEAD AGAINST POWERFUL OLIGARCHY.

CASTRO STILL SPEAKING AT 1:00 AM.

CASTRO SPEECH CONTINUES:

DURING BLOODY BATISTA TYRANNY YANKEE OLIGARCHY DID NOT TELL THEIR TOURISTS
NOT TO COME, DID NOT CUT OUR QUOTA. USG CANNOT CONFRONT THIS TRUTH; IT
CANNOT DENY IT; IT HAS HAD TO DROP MASK; BEFORE HISTORY IT WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO WASH OFF THAT STAIN. THEY WERE ASSOCIATES AND BENEFICIARIES OF CRIMINAL
REGIME OF BATISTA AND THEY CAN'T DENY THIS TRUTH. REPEATED THAT US AT TIME
INSTEAD OF CENSURING BATISTA HAD MILITARY MISSION TO TRAIN HIS ARMIES TO
KILL.  INSTEAD OF CUTTING SUGAR QUOTA, THEY INCREASED QUOTA OF RIFLES,
BULLETS, ETC.  THE CONCERN FOR IDEALS AND HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH US
HYPOCRITICALLY SAYS IT DEFENDS WAS NOT SHOWN WITH REFERENCE TO
MONSTROSITIES OF BATISTA.  AND YET US CALLS ITSELF LEADER OF FREE WORLD.
NOW THAT INTERESTS OF OLIGARCHY ARE AFFECTED AND CANNOT MOVE THROUGH
ESTABLISHED ARMY, LABOR LEADERS LIKE MYJAL, ETC.  THEY HAVE RECOURSE TO
CUTTING OUR QUOTA, TELLING TOURISTS NOT TO COME TO CUBA, TO LAUNCHING PRESS
CAMPAIGN AGAINST REVOLUTION.

US, TALKING ADVANTAGE OF BACKWARDNESS OF CUBA FOR WHICH IT IS RESPONSIBLE,
NOT TAKES AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST CUBA TO DEFEAT DESIRE OF CUBANS TO BE
FREE AND DETERMINE THEIR OWN DESTINY.  US HAS WANTED TO EXPLOIT, DOMINATE
AND GOVERN CUBA.  THERE ARE NO CUBAN INTERESTS OR COMPANIES WHICH WANT TO
EXPLOIT US PEOPLE BUT VICE VERSA.

CASTRO STILL SPEAKING AT 1:40 AM.

FROM:    HABANA

TO:      Secretary of State

NO:      70, JULY 7

PRIORITY

CASTRO SPEECH CONTINUES:

CUBA NOT TO BLAME FOR US EXPANDING IMPERIALISM; FOR US COMPANIES AFTER WAR
OF INDEPENDENCE GRABBING CUBA'S BEST ASSETS; FOR RAPINE OF US INTERESTS -
BECAUSE CUBA WAS VICTIM.  US WILL CONFRONT SAME SITUATION IN OTHER
COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO CUBA.  WE WILL TELL THEM NOW THAT
THEIR PROBLEMS IN CUBA RESULT FROM THEIR MISTAKEN IMPERIALIST POLICY.
PEOPLE OF CUBA STRONGER THAN OLIGARCHY THAT RULES US.

WE ARE TOO DIGNIFIED TO PROTEST AGAINST AGGRESSIONS.  WE ARE RESIGNED AND
PROUD OF ROLE WE ARE PLAYING IN LIBERATION OF PEOPLE.  WE ARE CONFIDENT AND
SURE OF OUR PURPOSE BEFORE THEIR DRABBLE ATTITUDE WHICH SHOWS IMPOTENCE AND
SHAMELESSNESS.

TODAY THEY CUT OUR QUOTA 700,000 TONS.  WAIT TO LEAVE US IN HUNGER AND
RUIN.  THINK THEY CAN DESTROY IN ONE AFTERNOON DESIRES OF PEOPLE AND WHAT
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AFTER MUCH STRUGGLE.  STUPID AND DECADENT.  WHAT DO THEY
WANT.  THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR THE 700,000 TONS OF SUGAR THAT WE TAKE BACK WAR
CRIMINALS AND YOKE OF AGGRESSION.  THEY WOULD ONLY LEAVE US A TORN SHRUB
AND HUNGER.  SHAMEFUL THAT THEY STILL EXPLOIT AND THREATEN SMALL NEIGHBOR
WHICH THEY SOILED AND EXPLOITED FOR SO LONG.

THEY CAN TAKE QUOTA BUT CANNOT DEFEAT REVOLUTION OR TRIUMPH OVER PEOPLE WHO
ARE AN EXAMPLE TO ALL OTHER PEOPLES OF WORLD.

THEY SHOWING OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DAY THEY TRY CONTROL THEIR OWN ECONOMIES
AND BREAK CHAINS COLONIALISM, THEY WILL TAKE THEIR QUOTAS TOO.  THEY WANT
DESTROY REVOLUTION, BUT ONLY MAKE IT FIRMER AND MORE RESOLUTE.  REVOLUTION
WILL GO FORWARD.  CUBA WILL GO FORWARD WITHOUT YOU (US) AND WILL SHOW OTHER
PEOPLES PATH.  CUBA NOT AFRAID. AGGRESSION WILL ONLY GAIN YOU CONDEMNATION
OF WORLD - IN SPITE OF YOUR LIES ABOUT CUBA.

DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL SUPPORT EVERYTHING TO MAINTAIN OUR
INDEPENDENCE AND DIGNITY.  PEOPLE - GENUINE PEOPLE - ARE DISPOSED TO
SACRIFICE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO FORGE NEW FATHERLAND.  DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT EVERY TRAITOR THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE CAN GO, THAT WE ONLY WANT
PATRIOTIC PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO DIE IN DEFENSE OF CUBA.  STUPID
POLICIES YOU ARE FOLLOWING WILL ONLY LEAD TO GREATER BLUNDERS.  YOU COULD
NOT HUMBLE US WITH CAMPAIGN OF CALUMNY AND AGGRESSION BY AIRPLANES SO NOW
YOU ARE TRYING ECONOMIC AGGRESSION.  ANSWER I AM GIVING YOU NOW, PEOPLE
WILL GIVE YOU NEXT SUNDAY:  MILITIAS, WORKERS, PEASANTS, YOUTHS, ALL CUBANS
WHO HAVE SENSE OF SHAME.  WE ARE PEOPLE OF A TIMBER WHICH WILL TRIUMPH AND
CAN WRITE PAGE OF HISTORY.  DON'T FORGET THAT WHEN THIS PEOPLE DEFEATED YOU
IN YOUR SUPPORT OF BATISTA, THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS ONLY BEGINNING OF
STRUGGLE AND THAT A MORE MERITORIOUS STRUGGLE LAY AHEAD.  BECAUSE WE DO NOT
KNOW HOW MANY MORE YEARS WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT YOU AND RESIST YOUR
AGGRESSIONS.  DON'T FORGET THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CAMILOS IN THAT
PEOPLE WHO ARE READY TO FIGHT.

CASTRO ENDED AT 2:20 AM.
