FULL TEXT OF ARTICLE: 1.  [Interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro by
Gladys Rubio; date and place not given-live]


2.  [Text] [Rubio] Commander, the UN resolution?

3.  [Castro] Yes.

4.  [Rubio] The UN resolution, the people are very happy about the Cuban
victory at the United Nations. We would like to know how you feel about this,
what has been fought for?

5.  [Castro] [words indistinct] expresses our opinion. I have expressed great
[word indistinct] on the television, the radio. We are all very happy, of
course. I have spoken about this. I spoke of this the day before, even. We had
the feeling we were going to obtain a majority but we did not expect that the
opposition to the resolution would be completely defeated. But it was defeated.
We did not expect the United States to get three votes, including theirs. And
my evaluation is that all those who were there, as I said last night at the
meeting with the pastors and the members of the [Pastor for Peace] caravan,
those that were there, expressed their rejection of the embargo in this manner.
And those that absented themselves expressed their rejection of the embargo in
this way. This is my opinion. Much more than what we hoped for happened.
