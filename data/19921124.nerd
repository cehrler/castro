FULL TEXT OF ARTICLE: 1.  [Report on statements by President Fidel Castro
during a banner-awarding ceremony honoring the Havana City CTC's ``1 May''
Canecutters Contingent at the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] on 23
November-live or recorded]

2.  [Text] In another part of that dialogue that Fidel had with the members of
the 1 May [Contingent], he commented on the elections held in the United
States. He said only 53 percent of the electorate had turned out to vote, and
he asserted that

ultra-reactionary ideas had suffered a hard blow in those U.S. elections.

3.  [Begin Castro recording] I think that these Pastors for Peace have just
given us proof of the reserves of morality possessed by the people of the
United States. [applause] From them arose a determination to challenge the
embargo and make a.... [pauses] collect resources to bring directly from....
[pauses] bring them from the United States to Cuba via Mexico. It could not be
done from the United States itself because no U.S. port can allow a Cuban ship
to drop anchor. Following that criminal law-that unscrupulous law that reminds
us of not only the Platt Amendment, but also Weyler's concentration plan during
the Spanish attempt to starve the Cuban people to death, to bring them to the
point of surrender through hunger-[repeats idea] after that law, here comes
this attitude on the part of a group of Americans, who, furthermore, acted with
impressive conviction, determination, and courage by challenging the embargo
[bloqueo]. They proved willing to do whatever might be necessary and in the
end, they achieved their goal. They breached the blockade [bloqueo].

4.  The value of this must be judged by its moral significance, not by the
amount of products, although we do appreciate those products as if they were
millions of tons. We appreciate each ton as if it were a million- regardless of
whether it was 12, or 14, or 15 million tons or just 15 tons. We appreciate
what they were able to bring as if it were 10 or 15 million tons of products,
because of the moral significance involved; because of the effort, the
sacrifices they made, going around collecting things ll over the United States
and loading trucks to take them to the border and then to a Mexican port to
ship them to Cuba. This is a truly impressive thing, which in our eyes gives
dignity to the American people. Because we should not ... [interrupted by
applause] ... we must not let ourselves be confused by the deeds of the
American people's governments. We must remember that the American people have
been the victims of lies, of deception, of demagogy, of confusion, of all kinds
of things, but that they have great reserves of morality. [end recording]
