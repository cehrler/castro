[Text] Santiago, Chile, 1 Dec--"Relations between Cuba and Spain are normal
at this moment," said Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro in a brief and
friendly talk with two reports from a Spanish news media in the neighboring
city of Velparaiso.

He was asked his opinion about the current state of relations between
Havana and Madrid after the temporary suspension of bilateral commercial
talks.

"What would you like me to say for Spain? Well, I would say that at this
moment our relations are normal."

Castro then assumed the role of reporter and asked about the Spanish
Government and recalled the civil war.

"How does your parliament work?" he asked. Before the newsmen could give a
complete answer the Spanish Cortes (legislative), Castro went on: "Well,
how about press freedom, and political ideas? Has political conscience made
any progress? What are the present possibilities for socialism in Spain?"

When the reporters began to reply the Cuban prime minister again
interrupted:

"The possibilities for socialism are remote, are they not? But you have
plenty of cars, a lot of tourism...."

At the end, very friendly throughout, the Cuban prime minister laughingly
admitted: "I am the one who is doing the questioning."
