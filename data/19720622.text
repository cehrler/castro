[Report on speech by Fidel Castro expressing thanks for Czechoslovak orders
presented to him at Prague Castle on 22 June 1972]

[Text] Comrade Castro expressed his thanks for the orders on behalf of
himself and his collaborators and spoke about Czechoslovak-Cuban
friendship. He said that all Cuban people followed with enthusiasm the
post-war development of Czechoslovakia, the creation of the CSSR and the
successes achieved in the country. He stressed that it was precisely
Czechoslovakia which was one of the first states to establish contacts and
friendly relations with Cuba. In particular he appreciated the help which
our republic rendered to the Cuban revolution in the most difficult times.
Comrade Castro also said that he and his entire entourage hold in grate
esteem this moment which will certainly contribute to strengthening mutual
friendship. It is a commitment for us to increase our efforts for deepening
the relations between the two communist parties. It is also a high moral
support for all Cuban people.
