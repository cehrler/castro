Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1218 GMT 14 Feb 72 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Text] Havana, 13 Feb--Prime Minister Maj Fidel Castro today closed the
first national plenum on production and productivity of the Farm and Social
Building Development [DESA] which met here for 3 days.

During these meetings 2,500 delegated and guests from all over the country
reviewed the tasks assigned to DESA last year and the plans for the current
year. They also discussed methods to improve productivity.

A sign bearing Fidel Castro's slogan "we can have all that we are able to
construct" was affixed to the rostrum. The maximum use of resources and
work methods and the study of deficiencies and errors were the main topics
discussed.

Maj Fidel Castro praised the construction work done by DESA, although he
said production should increase this year and insisted on the need to
accelerate the construction of countryside secondary schools.

Castro announced that some 100 new rural secondary schools should be
constructed by 1980. These schools are the same as those already operating,
each of which has a capacity for 600 boarding students who divide their
time studying and farm work.

The Cuban prime minister also noted the road projects under construction,
among them the eight-lane highway which will cross the country from east to
west and the construction projects which have been planned for beach
resorts in various places, including Varadero.

Mentioning other construction projects planned by the Revolutionary
Government, Castro said they are sorely needed and that "we do not have the
right to build in 1973 and 1974 those projects which we can build this
year."

DESA is assigned 68,500 workers, 60 percent of which reside in Orient and
Havana provinces. It built 426 projects last year.

President Osvaldo Dorticos, Politburo member Maj Ramiro Valdes and Central
Committee Secretariat member Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and other leaders sat
at the presidential table during the ceremony.
