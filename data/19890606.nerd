[Text] Last night, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro also attended the
ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of the Santa Fe omnibus
terminal in Havana City.  The ground breaking was done by brigade No 11 of
the Blas Roca contingent, and the terminal will be built by the Jesus
Suarez Gayol brigade of manual sugarcane cutters.

[Begin Castro recording] Thanks to your efforts, we have already been able
to begin construction.  When I see you working like this, at this time, I
have no doubt that this will be finished this year.  As I said a few days
ago, the creation of the Blas Roca contingent was a true revolution in
[passage indistinct] the highest point in the history of the country's
construction projects, regarding organization and productivity.  No
capitalist enterprise has ever built like the Blas Roca Contingent builds.
I will say something else:  There is not a country in the world, or
construction collective, that builds with the intensity and the
productivity with which the Blas Roca contingent builds.  For our
Revolution, our country, Cuba, it is a pride to have construction workers
like you.  That is why, as we warmly congratulate you and express our
excitement as we see what you have done in 27 days here, I say to you that
we feel really proud of having workers like you.  We feel happy, as
revolutionaries, as men who want to show what socialism is capable of
doing.  [applause] [crowd shouts:  Fidel! Fidel!] [end recording]

[Text] Today, the Fifth General Conference of the Nonaligned Movement Press
Agency pool [preceding word in English] will begin its work in Luanda,
capital of Angola.

The members of the pool's [preceding word in English] organizing committee
met yesterday in Luanda to approve the meeting's agenda, work on resolution
projects, and resume that organ's work.

The president of the Cuban Pool [preceding word in English] Coordinating
Committee, Pedro Margolles, classified as very important the fact that the
meeting was being held in Angola, which is playing an increasing role in
the region of southwest Africa.

Faced with the present circumstances in that region, the pool [preceding
word in English] has a great responsibility regarding the unification of
efforts of the Nonaligned Movement in its struggle against neocolonialism,
racism, and all forms of oppression, said Margolles.

Justice Minister Escalona on Legal Policies

[Interview with Justice Minister Juan Escalona by Josefa Bussi at the
Justice Ministry during "Exclusivo" program hosted by Daniel Torres--live
via mobile unit]

[Text] [Bussi] Thank you Daniel.  Good evening Cuba.  As you reported, we
are at the office of Justice Minister Juan Escalona who has been very kind
in agreeing to hold a brief exchange of views with the "Exclusivo"
listeners.  Good evening, Mr. Minister.

[Excalona] First of all, good evening.  Well, the ministry has functions
provided by the country's legislation.  They are fundamentally related to
advising the National Assembly and the Council and Ministers regarding the
creation of laws.  In the fulfillment of these responsibilities, we have
worked very hard in the changes made to the Criminal Code, the new Notary
Law, the Civil Registry, etc.  We are currently complying with the
decisions adopted regarding the process of rectification of mistakes.  We
are working on a bill that will modify the structure and operation of the
country's tribunals.  We are also working on a draft bill to change the
Family Code, in an attempt to modernize it.

Later, we have in the agenda of this legislative process significant
changes to the two procedural laws, civil and criminal procedural laws.  We
also have to work on the changes of our labor laws in the area of
procedures in attempt to get the laws in line with all those fantastic
experiences the labor movement is having, to all those experiences the
contingents are having, and to what is already being informed as legal
decisions regarding health, tourism, and other workers.

[Bussi] Mr. Minister, I believe that at this time there have been more
reports on the crimes being perpetrated in the country and, of course, on
the punishment.  Nevertheless, there are contradictory views.  It is said
that crime activities have increased since depenalization was implemented.
What is your opinion on this?

[Escalona] I can tell you with all confidence that, evidently, as of the
end of the year--since December and during the first few months of
1989--there has been a constant decrease, in general, of crime.  It is also
true that all manner of measures have been taken to achieve a more
effective confrontation against this type of conduct.  We think that....
[changes thought] In November we arrived at the following conclusion; there
was a policy of action, but really, the people ignored what we were doing.
One of the aspects that was studied and decided upon was that our people
had to know what we were doing to fight derelict conduct.  Ever since we
put into effect the legal codes and the massive jailing of criminals with
complete retroactivity of the code, we achieved the lowest level of
prisoners the revolutionary process has ever had during its 30 years of
existence.

Today, the situation is not the same.  We have increased the number of
prisoners to a few thousand.  These people are in the nation's jails as a
result of their conduct and criminal actions.  So you see, the answer has
always been there.  All of these factors, along with a regorous
administration that is careful and attentive to the well being of the
state, create the mechanisms that stop the averting of funds or whatever.
We have the conditions top, in a few short years, fully transform our
society's image.  I hope that when we hold the Eighth Congress in August
1990, we will be able to show the thousands of delegates who will be able
to show the thousands of delegates who will be coming from all over the
world a situation which is even better.  These delegates will be here to
observe this legal laboratory which is drawing their attention so much and
which so many people in the world want to see but do not dare to see
because of the policital implications.  Now the United Nations is going to
give us a hand by calling for this congress.  We are working on an
elaborate and ambitious work program for the Eighth United Nations Congress
to present a number of ideas and concepts we have in relation to this.
Then we will be able to show the world the reality of our country.

I am convinced that today, we having nothing to be ashamed of.  Tomorrow,
we will have many reasons to feel proud of ourselves.

[Brussi] Thank you very much, Mr Minister.  Regrettably, time for our
program is short and we cannot continue asking you the questions our people
would like to here.
