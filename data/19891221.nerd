2.  [Text] We have just received a cable from the PRENSA LATINA news agency
that highlights segments of the letter sent by Commander in Chief Fidel Castro,
president of the Councils of State and Ministers, to UN Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.  The cable begins like this:

3.  President Fidel Castro today demanded from the United Nations a decisive
action that will end the U.S. aggression against Panama.  In a letter sent to
UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, the highest Cuban leader warns
that the statements made by the members of the UN Security Council will not do
much good if they cannot stop the unpunished trampling of the United States on
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of another state.  He
also demands the cessation of aggression and the unconditional withdrawal of
the invaders.  In the letter, Fidel expresses his hope that the UN Security
Council, its president, and the UN secretary general act in a decisive manner,
in favor of the Panamanian people who are being attacked and are defending,
with integrity, their right to freely decide their destiny.

4.  The message adds that for the Cuban people and their government, which next
year will share the responsibility of the UN Security Council, the UN Charter
is not and cannot be just wet paper, a rhetorical reference that the powerful
can violate at their whim, mocking the right of the peoples.

5.  Fidel's message also says that this is an aggression by the United States,
one of the UN Security Council's permanent members, and as such it holds
special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security in a
country of approximately 2.5 million people.

6.  Another part of Fidel's letter states that today the blood of hundreds of
Panamanian patriots is being spread on the generous land that liberator Simon
Bolivar chose as the headquarters for the Amphictyonic Congress almost 100
years ago.

7.  Furthermore, the Cuban leader recalled that the interventionist clawings of
the U.S. Government against Santo Domingo, Grenada, and Nicaragua are still
recent wounds.

8.  Finally, the Cuban president insisted that the only peace and safety that
our people can hope for is that which we can obtain ourselves, with our
heroism; and that the only path to victory is the one of resistance that is
being carried out today in Panama against the invaders.
