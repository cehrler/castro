CASTRO COMMENTS ON DRUG TRAFFICKING, GUERRILLAS

PA232001 Bogota Radio Cadena Nacional in Spanish 1700 GMT 23 Feb 87

[Text] Once again, the U.S. Government was the target of criticism from
Cuban President Fidel Castro. In an exclusive report for RCN [Radio Cadena
Nacional], Fidel Castro said that the United States is solely responsible
for drug trafficking, as it is the largest drug consumer in the world.

In his statement for RCN, Castro said that the United States should
indemnify Latin America for the damage it is causing.

Fidel Castro also referred to Cuba's relations with the Colombian
guerrillas, stating that these relations are eminently political.

Datelined Bogota, here is a report by Jose Antonio Jose Caballero: In an
exclusive report for RCN, Cuban President Fidel Castro said that the United
States is the only one to be blamed for the drug trafficking problem,
adding that the United States should indemnify Latin America for the damage
it is causing.

The Cuban leader stressed: They created the market and the drug
consumption, and now they find it difficult to control it. He said that the
United States wants to resolve the drug production problem with repressive
measures. However, it must be resolved with measures for economic and
social development so that no one on the continent will have to earn a
living from coca or marijuana.

Castro told RCN that Cuba has adopted pertinent measures to fight drug
trafficking, although the problem does not affect Cuba directly. He added
that as a simply matter of principle, the Cuban Government fights all
drug-related activities.

In another report from Bogota, Cuban President Fidel Castro said that
accusations to the effect that the Cuban Government is a sanctuary for the
Columbian guerrilas and even for drug trafficking are so ridiculous that
they are not even worth a reply.

Castro noted that the Cuban policy toward Columbia during the past few
years has been exquisitely cautious in order to not meddle in Columbia's
domestic affairs. Castro added that it is a well-known fact that his
country has broad relations with various political forces in Columbia.

In his statement for RCN, Fidel Castro said that there is no rush in the
process to resume relations between Cuba and Colombia, because when this
takes place those relations must have solid and firm foundations. Castro
noted that the principle guiding Cuban policy in its relations with
Colombia is to proceed calmly, with an eye on the future, continuing with
the process so that when the links are restored, they will have a solid
base. Castro told RCN that there cannot be any hasty steps in relations
between the two countries. He stressed that his government is following
with interest the developments in Colombia, a country for which it has
great sympathy.
