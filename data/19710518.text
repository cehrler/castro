Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 1124 GMT 18 May 71 F

[Excerpt] The closing session of the ANAP plenum began with the
presentation by our prime minister of certificates recognizing "10 years of
work in the ANAP." Maj Fidel Castro chatted with the peasants who were
selected by the various provinces concerning various agricultural
activities.

ANAP President "Pepe" Ramirez told Maj Fidel Castro about the various
points covered and the conclusions reached at the plenum.

Maj Fidel Castro told the delegates to the plenum that "it would be much
better to have a conversation with them than to make a speech." This was
the spirit in which the closing session developed.

In the course of the dialog with the peasants, our prime minister showed
interest in their opinions regarding the development of agriculture in the
future.

Major Castro referred to the recent drought that beset our countryside and
said that the solution of this problem would lie in construction of dams
and in the optimum use of water resources.

In connection with the new generation and its relationship to agriculture,
he spoke about the secondary schools in the countryside and invited the
delegates to the sports meet between these schools at the Ceiba Uno school.
