[Text] [Video shows Fidel Castro chatting with people from Pinar del Rio,
people chant: "Fidel!"] [begin Castro recording] This has been a fabulous
experience. You have participated in this experience because you have
accompanied me and I am very impressed. I believe the results [of "Bastion
86" strategic exercises] have surpassed all expectations.

[Unidentified speaker] Comrade Commander, what is your impression about the
municipality of Vinales we visited this morning?

[Castro] It is incredible. It seems like a fantasy. Everyone, the entire
population, Vinales' 24,000 inhabitants participating in the exercises. I
have an extremely good impression of the country, especially of the Pinar
del Rio Province which we could say is at the vanguard. Well, it was one of
the top ones. It has contributed with many interesting experiences although
I understand the results in Camaguey were also extraordinary, and at the
mountain provinces in general the peoples' participation was greater than
anywhere else and, in many of these places, the presence of combatant
forces was 100 percent in less than 24 hours. What I have seen during these
days is unforgettable. We can be satisfied and feed proud of the evidence
our people have shown about its organizational capabilities, its sense of
responsibility, its patriotism, and revolutionary spirit. [people are seen
clapping and chanting: "Fidel!"] [end recording]
