Havana in Spanish to the Americas 1600 GMT 5 Mar 74 C

[Text] We admire the example of the Vietnamese woman, her total dedication
to the revolutionary struggle, her loyalty to the anti-imperialist cause
and her bravery and decisiveness in combat. This was stated in a message
sent by first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Fidel Castro, to
the Fourth Congress of the Vietnamese Women's Union, which began yesterday
in Hanoi.

The message points out that the scope and significance of the congress is
evident in the decisive role the Vietnamese women plays in the country's
economic, political and social life. Castro recalls that all through the
wonderful history of Vietnam its women have been examples of courage and
total dedication to the cause of sovereignty, independence and territorial
unity and integrity.

Vietnamese women, the message stresses, have borne their arms as brave
soldiers of the people. They have transported war equipment, medicine and
food to the frontlines; participated in the clandestine struggle;
encouraged their sons in battle, turning hatred into energy and paying
homage to death with new actions against the enemy.

The message from the leader of the Cuban Revolution concludes by asserting
that the resolutions to be adopted at the Fourth congress of the Vietnamese
Women's Union will undoubtedly play an important role in the future work of
our Vietnamese sisters and will constitute a new contribution to the
glorious cause of their people.
