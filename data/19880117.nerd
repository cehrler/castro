[Text] Our Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the PCC
Central Committee and president of the Councils of State and Ministers, has
met with the students of the Manuelito Aguilar pre-university institute in
Marianao, Havana City, who have built a house-office for the family doctor
and nurse.

[Begin Castro recording] Yesterday I was trying to find Lezcano [Joreg
Lezcano, first party secretary in Havana City Province].  In the afternoon,
he was over at the Nico Lopez refinery and at some other places.  When I
finally saw him, it was 9:30 [am or pm not specified]; no, it was around
10:00, and I was told that Lezcano was at some ceremony over there and that
he was inaugurating the family house-clinic built by the students.  So I
said, is that so?  And I didn't know about it.  No one told me.  I got a
card from you but no one told me that you were going to finish the house.
I would have like to have been there.  I would have made up a reason to be
there and see the first house, building completed by the students.

I was remembering the inauguration of that child care center that you
attended.  You made a lot of noise there [laughter]; you yelled.  You said
that you were going to build, repair.  Back then, we talked about your
working in your own schools.  But afterward we had an idea, and I told
Lezcano that since I didn't have the opportunity to attend the inauguration
of the (?school) I wanted to invite the famous minibrigade workers and the
others who have been participating in all that.  I also told him to invite
some journalists so that they can get to know you, the first minibrigade
student workers who have finished a project.  [end recording]
