[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has visited the new software
[preceding word in English] and robotics center located in Vedado, Havana
City.  He particularly expressed interest in the quality and production
costs, and he recommended the completion of some parts still under
construction.  It is already a semi-factory, said Fidel, when he was told
that three tool machines could be installed on the building's first floor
which has been designated for the construction of robot prototypes, printed
circuits, and paint and welding areas.

The workers gave an extensive briefing to the commander in chief on the
design and construction of a robot prototype, which is totally Cuban.  He
also saw a demonstration of the operations the robot can perform.  Fidel
asked about the cost of a robot on the international market and was told
that it is approximately $120,000.  However, the components which were
imported to assemble (?this) one and the Cuban only cost $24,000 which
could be reduced even more, according to specialists.

Another aspect which caught the commander's attention during this visit was
the creation of a numerical control for programmable laths [tornos] which
was tested on a training lath.  The control will soon be mounted on a
German lath at the La Lisa bus factory.  Fidel asked if it was possible to
mount this control on the laths which were bought in the USSR.  Armando
Rivero, director of the center, explained that not only could it be
mounted, but it may also be compatible with other controls bought in Spain
for 7 our of the 30 laths which have been imported from that country.  What
has been done here is marvelous, said Fidel, as he toured the areas for
program construction.

The commander in chief also toured the areas designated for the kitchen,
cafeteria, gym, library, and other facilities of this robotics center here
in Vedado, Havana City.
