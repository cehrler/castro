FULL TEXT OF ARTICLE:
1.  [Text] Explaining the need to collaborate to promote scientific activity in
the country, our Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, in his closing speech to the
constituent congress of the Science Workers Union, referred to three basic,
integral elements.

2.  [Begin Castro recording] In this effort toward scientific development,
differing mechanisms have been set up.  One must not think that we are only
going to have the union; the union is just another integration factor. We call
it that: to integrate, to cooperate. To seek that cooperation that is only
possible, and is so basic, in socialism.

3.  We have scientific forums-poles is a better way to say it. We have pursued
this based on the experiences of the first pole. We are looking for ways to
establish close cooperation among all the research centers in an area. At
first, the idea was to do it by geographical area. There were 10 or 12 centers,
so why should they not cooperate?  Cooperation among centers began two or three
years ago.  Then we started looking for other centers in the same field that
were not geographically close. For example, CENPALAB [Center for Production of
Laboratory Animals] is located near Santiago de las Vegas and Biological
Compounds, an installation that is almost finished and which will begin
operation soon-it is partially working now-located near Bejucal. The Cuban
Institute for Technical Research [ICIT] is in East Havana, close to Guanabacoa.
The Institute of Animal Science is in Madruga. The National Center for Animal
Health is in San Jose, but they are all related.

4.  Therefore, what began as a relationship based on geographic location became
a relationship based on fields of work. There is a center, the ICIT, that seems
to have nothing to do with biological technology and medical sciences; but it
has proven to be essential, and its importance was shown here. We are going to
develop a great center, a good center. They had several construction projects
that were to be done in conjunction with the Soviets for electronic development
in the eastern part of the country, but all that has blown away, as Proa would
say. They quickly drafted a project and began construction. In less than two
years we will have completed the ICIT Research and Production Center. For some
time, they have been supporting the scientific research centers that work with
electronic computers, besides all the other important things that they do. This
electronic center seemed to have no relation to these centers, but they have an
enormous relation to the centers, and today we saw here that they can help
other centers of the country. [end recording]

5.  Fidel added that among the great efforts being made in the country,
scientific activity must be prioritized and given full attention.
