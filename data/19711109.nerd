REPORTAGE CONCERNING CASTRO'S VISIT TO CHILE

Chilean TV Interview

Havana in Spanish to the Americas 1600 GMT 9 Nov 71 C

[Text] A telephone interview with Cuban Prime Minister Maj Fidel Castro was
broadcast early this morning on the Chilean domestic television channel.
Replying to questions from Channel 7 director Augusto Olivares, Maj Fidel
Castro said he is anxious to arrive in Chile to greet the people and their
president, Salvador Allende. The Cuban prime minister confirmed that he
will arrive in Santiago at 1700 Wednesday which, he said, should end
speculation about his trip.

Chilean television viewers heard Maj Fidel Castro speak while watching his
photograph on the television screen. I have not had the honor of visiting
Chile and you know that the Cubans have a lot of admiration and love for
the Chileans, Fidel Castro told the television channel director. He then
added: In Chile, I will work 24 hours a day to fulfill the numerous
invitations I have received.

The Cuban prime minister emphasized that he is very much interested in
meeting with all sectors: workers, students, peasants, and intellectuals.
Regarding some attacks unleashed in Chile regarding his trip, Maj Fidel
Castro said: Those attacks do not concern me, since they will not obscure
the gentlemanly attitude and the sense of hospitality of the Chileans.
