1.  [Speech by President Fidel Castro at ceremony to honor the people who
``guaranteed the successful development of the 11th Pan-American Games,'' at
the Karl Marx Theater in Havana-live or recorded]

2.  [Text] [Applause] Dear comrades, during the last few days of the 11th
Pan-American Games we began to talk to the comrades from INDER [National
Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation Institute], the organizers of the
games, and all the other comrades who participated in this important activity,
about the need to give those who worked to prepare, organize, and carry out the
various events of these games proper recognition. The truth is that we felt
that they had done an excellent job. We-those of us who attended the games-were
not the only ones who believed this; it was the unanimous feeling among our
guests. I believe that it was quite appropriate for PASO [Pan-American Sports
Organization] President Vasquez Ranas to say during the closing ceremony, these
games had been the best Pan-American Games in the history of the games. If we
take into consideration the circumstances under which we worked; if we take
into consideration the propaganda from abroad against our country which said
that we were not capable of achieving this success; if we take into
consideration all the difficulties we confronted, including the economic
difficulties; then we can say that the games represented an extraordinary
success.  [applause]
