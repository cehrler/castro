Arrives in Valparaiso

Havana in Spanish to the Americas 1800 GMT 1 Dec 71 C

[Text] The warm reception Major Fidel Castro has received in Valparaiso
shattered the campaign organized by the Christian Democratic Party and the
National Party, which tried to create an atmosphere of uncertainty over the
arrival of the Cuban Communist leader.

Also, provocateurs from the fascist organization Fatherland and Freedom had
presumed that they had intimidated the people of Valparaiso, but thousands
of persons gave a cordial welcome to the highest leader of our revolution.

During the early morning hours the day before Fidel's arrival, unidentified
persons who were removing welcome signs stabbed the regional secretary of
the Socialist Party, Roberto Iribarra, when he tried to stop them.

The Mayor of Valparaiso, Sergio Vuskowvich Rojo, said at the beginning of a
welcoming ceremony that the popular reception given to Fidel was proof that
in Chile the right's will will not be done. The fascist organization,
Fatherland and Freedom, had said that Fidel would not visit Valparaiso
because he feared a threat against his life. The rightist provocateurs have
been active in Chile during the last few days. Shortly after the end of the
ceremony at which Fidel spoke, two unidentified persons threw rocks against
the car in which President Salvador Allende was traveling. They escaped
apprehension. As a reply to this disturbing aggression, the Chilean
president got out of the car, and with the applause of the Valparaiso
people, he continued on foot for several blocks.
