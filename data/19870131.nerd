FL311333 Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 31 Jan 87

[Text] Comrade Fidel Castro presided over the first monthly meeting in 1987
of the central group on Wednesday.

Also participating in the meeting were members of the Communist Party of
Cuba [PCC] Central Committee Polithuro and Secretariat, the president of
the National Assembly, government vice presidents, ministers, heads of the
state's central administration organs, presidents of the people's
governments provincial assemblies, and chiefs of PCC Central Committee
departments, among other party and government officials.

The central group made a detailed analysis of the performance of the
current sugar harvest, pointing out that there is no other task more
important for the revolution at this time than completing the harvest and
planting 30,000 caballerias of sugar cane as planned.

Comrade Fidel highlighted the importance of making a detailed analysis of
the factors that have adverse effects on the costs and profitability of the
sugar industry. He went on to stress that under the present conditions, it
is hard to explain why certain enterprises that are working efficiently are
not profitable and yet enterprises that do not perform efficiently show
positive balances.

The central group also reviewed the fundamental aspects of the winter
harvest of tubers and vegetables, the utilization of by-products and
residue of the sugar industry to feed animals, and the limitations that are
hampering a speedier development of agricultural production. Comrade Fidel
also spoke of the need to work more seriously and effectively in the
construction of dams, microdams, and irrigation systems that will make it
possible to use reservoirs rapidly and efficiently and to augment the
production of rice, beans, and fruit, including pineapple.
