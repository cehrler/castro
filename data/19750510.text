[Text] Havana May 10 TASS--The lifting of the economic blockade of Cuba
imposed by the United States is a preliminary condition for the start of
bilateral talks on normalization if relations between the two countries. We
cannot conduct talks under pressure, said Fidel Castro. The Cuban leader
held a press-conference upon completion of meetings with U.S. Senator
George McGovern, who was on an unofficial visit in that country.

Fidel Castro said that Cuba prefers full lifting of the blockade at the
same time a sufficiently wide lifting would contribute to the attainment of
this goal. It would become an important step tat would lead to a
reassessment by the Cuban side of relations with the USA.

Fidel Castro stressed the [as received] despite difficulties existing in
relations between them, Cuba and the USA must live in peace. Fidel Castro
condemned the present regime in Chile by describing it as a fascist one and
expressed hope that the Chilean people will throw down the yoke of fascism
in the not very distant future.
