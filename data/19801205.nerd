[Text] Madrid, 5 Dec (EFE)--The most serious problem in the world right now is
the Polish situation, Fidel Castro told Spanish opposition leader Felipe
Gonzalez in a meeting they held in Havana. An exclusive report on this meeting
appeared today in the Madrid newspaper DIARIO 16. It was signed by the assistant
director of this newspaper, the only newsman present during the meeting of the
two political leaders.

Fidel Castro spoke with Felipe Gonzalez for more than 2 hours in a room at the
airport in Havana where the Socialist leader made a stepover on his way to
Panama and Washington, where he will participate in a meeting of the Socialist
International.

Regarding Poland, Castro said, I think that the Soviet Union is being too
"patient."

"What I am worried about," he added, "is that the concern over the Polish
domestic situation is also being observed in other countries bordering on
Poland," presumably the GDR.

Castro said that he refused to believe that Afghanistan will become the future
Vietnam for the USSR and, according to DIARIO 16, he openly disagreed with
Felipe Gonzalez in this regard. Gonzalez maintained his harsh and intransigent
criticism of the Soviets on this.

Regarding Ronald Reagan's victory, the Cuban leader said that "the Iranians were
directly responsible for Kenney's and Carter's defeat."

"Reagan," Castro confessed, "is a legitimate worry for Latin America." He also
noted that if Reagan is harboring any intentions of intervening in Latin
America, he may cause process of radicalization to speed up.

Regarding this he cited as the first examples the cases of Bolivia and Chile,
where certain leftist forces, including the Chilean communists, have decided to
resort to the armed struggle.

According to DIARIO 16, Fidel Castro further said that the Salvadoran leftwing
is increasingly stronger just like the Guatemalan left. He also said that the
Sandinists are definitely consolidating their position.

Regarding this, he said that the idea of the Socialist International to create a
committee of support for Nicaragua is very positive.

The Cuban leader also said that he is convinced that the Sandinists should
maintain a mixed economic system and respect the formal liberties.

The humorous moment of the meeting came when they exchanged gifts. DIARIO 16
said that Fidel Castro gave Felipe Gonzalez a box of the famous "Cohibas" cigars
while the Spanish Socialist leader responded with one ham and two boxes of Rioja
Spanish wine.
