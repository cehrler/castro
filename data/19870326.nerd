Speaks With Workers

FL270147 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300 GMT 26 Mar 87

[Excerpts] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, president of the Councils of
State and Ministers of Cuba, today inaugurated Havana's (Werner Lambert)
knitting mill, located in the eastern part of the capital. [passage
omitted]

Fidel had a lively chat with the workers and leaders of the new knitting
mill.

[Begin Castro recording] One of the things we believe is that this industry
is a textile industry instead of a clothing manufacturing factory. He who
visits this factory can see that this factory is mainly a textile industry.
We are considering transferring this industry from the clothing
manufacturing area to the textile area, to the union of textile
enterprises. I do not know what you think about that.

[Female speaker] Actually, we manufacture fabric here with a different
technology but [words indistinct]

[Castro] It is a textile enterprise. I though, what is a knitting mill
doing in the clothing manufacturing industry? A clothing manufacturing
industry is something else. This is a textile plant and a fairly
sophisticated one.

[Female speaker] Before, our knitting mills were shops with a few knitting
machines and next to it they had machines to manufacture clothes with the
textile that was produced. It was a somewhat primitive thing.

[Castro] Now this is large textile plant. It will produce 50 million square
meters. What is it if it is not a textile plant? What is a plant that
produces 50 million square meters with any kind of technology, a plant that
is supposed to produce 50 million square meters? [end recording] [passage
