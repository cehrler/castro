June 8, 1960 1330 GMT--E

(Excerpts)  Havana--Premier Fidel Castro delivered the final speech at the
closing session of the first revolutionary congress of the national
federation of workers employed in barbers and hairdressers establishments
at the confederation of workers of Cuba building.  "For each
measure taken against Cuba," he declared "there will be a revolutionary
countermeasure and if they attack us, we shall order the confiscation of
all North American property in our country."  He added that the future of
Cuba is now more assured than ever, saying that we are masters of what is
ours and we do with it what we consider best for our own interests.

Referring to the latest note delivered to the Cuban Foreign Ministry by the
U.S. Government, he said that the recent note used crude and aggressive
language, the provocative language of the intruder, of those who meddle in
things which do not concern them.  He then asked:  Do they expect the
revolution to fall back and the people to vacillate although the government
stands firm?  Do they expect us to return to the North American companies
the lands which the people have recovered?  Do they expect Cuba to renounce
its sovereignty and its right to maintain trade relations with the nations
it considers appropriate?  We are very sorry for them, but we cannot oblige
them."

The Premier pointed out that the sister nations of Latin America are also
awakening and that these peoples sooner or later will follow Cuba's
example.  The Premier also referred to the maneuver which the United States
is now engaged in against dictator Trujillo.

Speaking of his talks with the leaders of Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay,
and Venezuela, he said they have been fruitful in every respect.

Dorticos' message was broadcast to the Rancho Boyeros airport control tower
and disseminated over the independent front of free stations--FIEL.  Prime
Minister Fidel Castro was said to be at the airport listening to the
message.

(Excerpts)  Havana--President Dorticos said Wednesday that in Venezuela he
received the fullest popular support for the Cuban revolution.  In a short
press conference held on the plane taking him to Mexico, Dorticos said that
in every country he has visited--Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Peru, and
Venezuela--he received popular expressions of support, but "enthusiasm
overflowed in Venezuela and made us remember our life in Cuba."

The interview was carried on with Cuban newsmen accompanying the President
on his American tour.
