PRIORITY

Fidel Castro met by large jubilant crowds upon return May 8. Spoke to
estimated 5 or 600,000 people for nearly four hours at Plaza Civica.
Obviously tired. Principal points were:

(1) Left country to defend and explain revolution abroad. Had great success
speaking to 6,000 newsmen, 100 million people. Emphasized contact with
people and never mentioned foreign governments.

(2) Cuban revolution unique and pure, is great event of hemisphere. Watched
closely by other countries, most of whom have grave problems. Cuban
revolution must not fail since would set back cause freedom and economic
development throughout hemisphere.

(3) Cuban revolution: Four things which make it unique: People, army,
doctrine and truly revolutionary laws.

(4) Criticism of revolution, including concern over communism comes from
enemies abroad. Cuban Government is most hones, liberal and democratic in
world and will not suppress any ideas nor any expression of opinion. No one
should fear the revolution, which inspired by highest motivations. No one
has right to interfere in Cuba, to give counsel, to examine conscience of
revolution.

(5) Revolution neither capitalist, Communist nor center, but rather step in
advances of all. Said current would conflict was between concept which
offered people democracy and starved them to death, and concept which
offered food but suppressed liberties. Cuban solution was to promote all
rights of mankind, including "social rights". Only ideas which satisfy both
material and spiritual needs of mankind will prosper.

(6) Revolution and leaders not divided on any ideological grounds. Rather
all leaders closely united and loyal. Revolution had one supreme leader,
whose authority never questioned.

(7) Revolution supported by vast majority people, including peasants,
workers, intellectuals, professional civil servants, youth, middle class
and nationalistic industrialists.

(8) Two principal questions abroad were executions and elections. He had
satisfactorily explained both and obtained approval of foreign public
opinion. Execution would taper off. Whenever elections were held another
revolutionary government would take power. No dates mentioned.

(9) Destructive phase of revolution ending, constructive phase beginning.
All Cubans must now work and he must be left alone to concentrate on
problems.

Comment: General attitude of enormous crowds best described as nearly
hysterical adualtion of "greatest man of hemisphere" and personal leader of
country and embodiment of revolution. This is one man rule with full
approval of "masses".
