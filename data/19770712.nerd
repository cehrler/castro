[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central
Committee and president of the Council of State and Council of Ministers,
has sent a letter to the national organizing committee and provincial
council of the Merchant Marine, Ports and Fisheries Workers Trade Union for
the meritorious work performed by Havana port workers.

Our commander in chief states in the letter that the party leadership has
followed closely everything done by the port workers to reduce demurrage
payments and prevent the overstocking of merchandise in areas near the
piers.  And he emphasizes:  I truly believe that the work done to date is
highly meritorius.  In fact, the situation we were confronted with in the
past has been turned around completely.

He then emphasizes that demurrage payments were reduced by more than $15
million during the second half of 1976 and in the first few months of this
year we have a favorable balance of almost $.05 million as a result of
prompt handling [of cargo].  Improvised open-air warehouses have been
disappearing and the organizations to which the merchandise is destined are
removing it more quickly.

In his letter to port workers Fidel emphasizes:  I note with gratification
that established plans are being fulfilled, that productivity per man is
increasing, that socialist emulation is gaining force, that volunteer work
is being given its proper stress and, moreover, that Havana port workers
are making a noteworthy contribution to the important task of cleaning up
and cultivating sugarcane fields.

Lastly, our commander in chief's letter to Havana port workers states:
This is a worthy and revolutionary labor response to the country's needs.
This is the type of attitude we need in order to tackle and overcome any
difficulty.  The battle in the ports continues.  It will continue to be a
hard one and there can be no letup.  We know that we still have problems to
be solved.  But we also know that the Havana port workers, their trade
union and, along with them, the state organization will not rest on their
laurels but these will serve as an incentive to move ahead and establish
higher achievements.  That is the proletarian, revolutionary and communist
thing to do.  I give you a revolutionary embrace.  [signed] Fidel Castro
