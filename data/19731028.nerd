FIDEL SENDS GREETINGS TO WORLD PEACE CONGRESS

Havana in Spanish to the Americas 1200 GMT 28 Oct 73 C

[Text] Prime Minister and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba,
Maj Fidel Castro, has sent greetings to the World Peace Congress being held
in Moscow, the capital of the USSR. The message which was released by the
Cuban delegation, states:

Greetings to the World Peace Congress, the expression of humanity's hopes
for peace and for a just solution to the international problems which
prevents its achievement. The Vietnamese people's victorious heroism, Maj
Fidel Castro's letter says, the peoples' firm struggles for national
liberation, the peace policy of the USSR and the other socialist countries,
and the mobilization of tens of millions of women and children of all
classes ideologies and beliefs have been decisive factors in the important
steps toward the easing of recent international tensions.

Further on, the greeting which Major Castro sent to the World Peace Council
adds: The bloody war unleased in the Middle East by Israel's attempt to
maintain--with the support of U.S. imperialism--the Arab territories
obtained by war gives us an idea of the grave problems which the forces for
peace still have to overcome on the road to peace. Castro recalled that the
conference of nonalined countries has established in its schedule of
activities the indissoluble connection between the aspirations of the
underdeveloped peoples who are struggling to conquer colonialism,
neocolonialism and its vestiges, and the necessary peace of truly universal
dimensions toward which we all aspire.

In other part of his message to the World Peace Congress Castro adds: The
World Peace Congress forces have underlined the interrelated aspects of the
struggle for peace, democracy and independence, by recalling--at the outset
[of the meeting]-- the immortal example of President Salvador Allende and
by expressing its support of the heroic firmness of the Chilean rejection
of the fascist policy which the military junta seeks to impose in order to
gain hand over the Chilean economy and national sovereignty to U.S.
exploiters.

Major Castro's message ends by saying that Cuba, represented at this
congress by a delegation which is the expression of all the forces of Cuban
society, commits its actions to the common effort to struggle for peace,
national sovereignty and progress for humanity.
