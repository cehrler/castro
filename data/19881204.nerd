[Text] President Fidel Castro reiterated his call for Latin American unity
when he placed a wreath in Mexico City at the Monument to the Hero Children
of Chapultepec.  The monument was constructed in honor of the young Mexican
cadets who lost lives defending national sovereignty from U.S. invaders.

The ceremony was of great significance because in 1955, in front of this
same monument, Fidel Castro, who was then in exile in Mexico, vowed he
would someday return to this historical site after attaining true
independence for Cuba.

After the ceremony to honor the Hero Children of Chapultepec, the highest
Cuban leader reaffirmed to reports that Latin America has no alternative
but to search for its unity and integration.  Fidel Castro said any step by
Mexico or any other country in the area seeking to solve the foreign debt
problem would be very positive.  However, Castro insisted the ideal would
be a joint action by all nations in the region.  The Cuban president has
been in Mexico since 30 November, for the inauguration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
