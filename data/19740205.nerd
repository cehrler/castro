to Cuba; portions within slantlines are additions supplied from PRENSA
LATINA's version of the declaration]

[Text] During his stay in Cuba from 28 January to 3 February of the present
month, CPSU General Secretary Leonid Ilich Brezhnev and the first secretary
of the peoples Communist Party of Cuba, Commander Fidel Castro, signed a
joint declaration.

The document notes that the first visit of Brezhnev to the first Latin
American country that is building socialism, evoked a vivid manifestation
of revolutionary enthusiasm and solidarity from the Cuban workers,
simultaneously marking a new phase in the development of Cuban-Soviet
friendship.

During the visit, the declaration states, the indestructible unity between
the peoples of Cuba and the USSR was manifested and new paths were opened
to continue deepening fraternal collaboration between the two countries.

The document points out that the exchange of experiences on the domestic
development of Cuba and the Soviet Union was useful and valuable. The
highest leaders of Cuba and the Soviet Union--Fidel Castro and Leonid
Brezhnev--declare their full identity of criteria with regard to the
present situation in the world and the tasks of socialist states' foreign
policy.

The document adds that that policy is geared to the defense of the freedom
independence and sovereign rights of the states and the peoples--a policy
of struggling for the consolidation of international peach and
collaboration.

The Communist Party of Cuba, the declaration states, highly appreciates the
unceasing activity put forth in all fields by the CPSU and all the Soviet
people, in fulfillment of the decisions of the 24th CPSU Congress. The
culmination of third year of the 5 year plan, which is the decisive year,
has raised the Soviet economy--the economy of developed socialism--to new
heights.

The Soviet Union, the declaration underscores, has exceeded the tasks set
for the 1973 plan for industrial production, and the increasing of work
productivity--the most important index for the efficacy of industrial
production. In the Soviet Union, the document states, great industrial
complexes have been built, and the recently discovered deposits of natural
resources are being exploited. The measures taken by the CPSU and the
Soviet Government in the sphere of agricultural-livestock development, have
netted, as a result, a considerable increase of production.

The joint Cuban-Soviet declaration, signed during the presence of Leonid
Brezhnev our country, states that the most abundant harvest of cereals,
cotton and other products in the USSR history had been collected.

At the Directorate of National Economy, the CPSU gives priority to matters
linked the new rise of the economy by means of introducing the advancements
of the scientific-technological revolution. At the same time, the joint
declaration recalls, the system of planning and management is being
perfected in order to increase the broad program for bettering the people's
well-being.

And it adds: It has been proven once again that the exertion of socialist
[Unreadable text] by all the people is the fair method for mobilizing the
popular operative forces, [Unreadable text] order to fulfill the goals set
by the party. The fulfillment in advance of the [Unreadable text] of the
plan, the additional plans, the energetic struggle and the inexhaustible
creativeness of the workers to raise productivity and the quality of
production further strengthen the country of the Soviets and help resolve
the historic task of building communism.

The joint declaration signed by Leonid Brezhnev and Fidel Castro states
that the Cuban people warmly hail all the achievements of the Soviet
people, which are the base of the USSR's economic and defensive power, and
underscores the USSR's beneficent influence in international life. The
advances made by the USSR inspire other socialist countries. They infuse
new strength into all who defend the cause of freedom, democracy, national
independence and social progress; they create an evermore solid material
base for the struggle for the peoples' peace and security.

The document then states that the CPSU and the Soviet people hail the
successes of the Cuban people, rallied around their Communist Party in the
fulfillment of the great task of building the socialist society, the great
task of building a society that is free from exploitation and directed by
the workers themselves for the good of all the people.

The far-reaching socio-economic changes and the tremendous progress in
furthering education and culture are changing the life of the Cuban people
and constitute an inspiring example for many other peoples who are
struggling for national liberation and social progress, the joint
declaration states. And it adds: Of fundamental significance is the work
being made to perfect the organic structure of the PCC and to consolidate
the party ranks to prepare for the party's congress, to develop the
socialist system, centralized planning, and the education of the vast
popular masses in the spirit of the Marxist-Leninist ideas.

It notes that the recent celebration, by all the people, of the 20th
anniversary of the heroic assault on Moneada Barracks and the 15th
anniversary of the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, facilitated a national
review of the gains made by Cuba in its social, economic and cultural
development.

In another passage, the Cuban-Soviet declaration states that the 13th
Congress of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers had stimulated the
political-labor activity of the working class and all of Cuba's workers.
The document recalls that all of the foregoing is eloquent proof that Cuba
is undergoing a period of ebullient political-economic life; that the
communists hold high the glorious banner of the Cuban people's
revolutionary traditions; and, that the Cuban Socialist Revolution has
entered into a new phase of its development in which the successes gained
are strengthened and deepened.

The declaration states that Cuba and the USSR have the conviction that the
indestructible friendship and fraternal cooperation between both peoples
and both communist parties, respond to the cardinal interests of both
countries, of all the socialist community, and the interests of
international peace and security.

Guiding us along the principles of socialist internationalism, in the
spirit of full equality of rights and the mutual respect of sovereignty,
Cuban-Soviet friendship continues to be strengthened and developed by all
means. The joint declaration states that the foregoing is the invaluable
patrimony of the peoples of the USSR and Cuba who are joined together by
the enjoyment of a common social regime and embrace common goals in the
peaceful building of socialism and communism. It then sets forth that Cuba
and the USSR pledge to put forth all the needful efforts for both peoples
to know each other better, and for a constant expansion of cooperation
through their communist parties, state organizations, labor unions and
their youth, women's, and mass organizations. At the same time, Cuba and
the USSR pledge to intensify contacts among the representatives of the
various sectors of their inhabitants.

Cuba and the USSR will develop and perfect constantly their economic,
commercial, and scientific-technical collaboration on a planned, long-range
basis, implementing the economic agreements signed in 1972. Particular
attention will be given to increasing the efficacy of economic cooperation;
cooperation will be expanded among the planning organizations, the
ministries and their departments and other institutions of both countries.
Direct contacts between the production collectives of Cuba and the USSR
will also be increased.

In accordance with the agreements, the USSR will provide Cuba with
assistance in developing its industry, the mechanization of agriculture and
the training of qualified personnel for the various fields of the national
economy. The declaration adds that Cuba and the USSR will develop, by all
means, cooperation between institutions of scientific research, teaching
centers and the unions of artists of the two countries.

In the Cuban-Soviet declaration, Leonid Brezhnev, on behalf of the CPSU,
state and all the Soviet people, confirmed their willingness to keep giving
Cuba their fraternal cooperation and support in building the new life.

Fidel, in the name of our Communist Party, state and Cuban people,
reiterated the most profound gratitude to the Soviet Union for its
internationalist solidarity, manifested by the generous aid that has been
given Cuba in al fields in the construction of the socialist society.

The joint declaration points out that the most solid foundation for the
inviolable Cuban-Soviet friendship is the fraternal collaboration existing
between the two revolutionary Marxist-Leninist parties, which have devoted
all their efforts to the struggle for the happiness of the working people
and for the construction of the socialist and communist society. It adds:
Both parties consider the development of this collaboration as a task of
paramount importance.

The Cuban-Soviet declaration emphasizes that the communist parties of both
countries will continue to expand and improve uninterruptedly their
collaboration at all levels, /systematically exchanging delegations of
party officials, strengthening the contacts between part press organs/ and
at the same time to broaden the exchange of experiences in the socialist
and communist construction. The document points out that under the present
conditions--marked by the continued ideological struggle in the world
arena, the constant attempts on the part of reactionary propaganda to
surround the socialist countries with a smokescreen of slander and
falsehood and give the peoples of their countries a distorted view of the
truth about socialism so as to distract the attention from the growing
internal crisis of the capitalist system--the communist parties of the USSR
and Cuba stress the need to tirelessly and effectively expose the
slanderers, give strong rebuffs to any form of ideological subversion by
the antisocialist forces and to more widely inform world public opinion
about life in socialist countries.

The PCC and the CPSU consistently come out for the utmost unity of the
international communist and labor movement, points out the joint
declaration signed by Leonid Brezhnev and Fidel. The document affirms that
both parties will also continue to counteract vigorously any attempts to
pit the different sections of the world revolutionary vanguard, one against
the other and to divide the forces fighting for social progress, the
national liberation of the peoples and a stable peace. Both parties are
irreconcilable both to the rightwing and leftwing revisionism and
hegemonistic and chauvinist tendencies which contradict the
internationalist course that was collectively worked out by the communist
and workers parties. The strengthening of the unity of the world communist
movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism has been and continues to be a
guarantee of the development and depending of the entire revolutionary
process.

The Cuban-Soviet declaration recalls that half a century has passed since
the death of Lenin, the great teacher and leader of the working people of
the world, who blazed a path to socialism for all mankind. The course of
international events since then to the present day verifies then and now
the correctness of the Leninist analysis of the main tendencies of world
development.

The world is moving forward in the direction precisely predicted by Lenin,
underlines the Cuban-Soviet document. It stresses that the might of the
world socialist system and its influence on the course of international
events continue to grow. It adds: the struggle for national liberation of
the peoples has won historic victories. Under its pressure the chains of
neocolonialism, with which the imperialists are trying to replace the old
colonial regimes, now are also being broken.

The Cuban-Soviet declaration indicates that the further aggravation of the
general crisis of capitalism is more apparent today than ever before. The
capitalist world finds itself shaken by political and economic
contradictions unprecedented in scale and acuteness. As a result of the
general change in the correlation of forces, the concerted policy of
countries of the socialist community and of the efforts of other
progressive and peace-loving forces, a turnabout in international relations
from the cold war to detente has become possible to the assertion of
international relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence of
states with difference social systems.

Cuba and the USSR consider it the central task of their foreign policy to
contribute to the consolidation of the might and unity of the socialist
community and to the developing of collaboration, a determining factor in
the growth of its economic and political potential.

Cuba and the USSR are convinced that the might of world socialism, as well
as the unity and solidarity of the countries of the socialist community,
linked by indestructible bonds of brotherhood, mutual assistance and
unselfish support, represent in our age the main revolutionary force. The
document stresses that that force puts forth a determining influence on the
course of the world social development.

Cuba and the USSR attach great importance both to improving the existing
forms of bilateral and multilateral ties and to the constant search for new
ways of cooperation between fraternal countries in the political, economic
and other fields. Cuba and the Soviet Union intend to continue to give
permanent attention to the problems of socialist economic integration,
prepared within the framework of the CEMA.

Cuba and the Soviet Union strongly condemn any acts of imperialist
aggression that endanger the life and peaceful work of the peoples and
solemnly declare their unshakable devotion to the cause of world peace.
Peace is essential for solving the cardinal problems of our times and for
social progress. The joint declaration adds that peace creates favorable
conditions for the socialist countries to build socialism and communism. It
gives wide opportunities to the peoples waging national liberation
struggles to strengthen political independence, attain economic autonomy
and liquidate the colonial and racist regimes. It facilitates the struggle
of the workers of capitalist countries against exploitation and for their
lawful rights.

In the joint document signed by Leonid Brezhnev and our Commander in Chief
Fidel Castro, it is determined that peace is indivisible and should affect
all countries irrespective of their geographic scale, economic and military
might and social system. It is only a stable, democratic and just
peace--based on the renunciation of the use of arms as a means of resolving
disputes and differences between states--if it presupposes strict respect
for the sovereignty of all states and excludes all interference in their
internal affairs and creates conditions for fruitful collaboration among
all countries on an equal basis.

The Communist Party and the Revolutionary Government of Cuba stress the
great international significance of the USSR foreign policy and the
successful fulfillment of the peace program worked out by the CPSU 24th
Congress.

The joint declaration adds that the Communist Party and Government of Cuba
fully solidarize with the principled, consistent and class foreign policy
of the CPSU and the Soviet state. The CPSU and the USSR Government highly
appreciate the contribution of the PCC Central Committee and the
Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba, by means of their active
foreign policy, in attaining the common goals that have been set by the
countries of the socialist community in the international arena. The
international prestige of Socialist Cuba grows uninterruptedly, stresses
the document signed by the general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee,
Leonid Brezhnev, and the first secretary of the PCC Central Committee,
Fidel Castro.

The Cuban-Soviet declaration states that the victory of the heroic
Vietnamese people in the struggle against the imperialist aggression, as
well as the signing of the agreement ending the war and restoring peace in
Vietnam, are an event of historic significance. It is a victory for the
Vietnamese people and at the same time a victory for international
solidarity, for socialism's forces, for freedom-loving and anti-imperialist
forces, for all parties for peach and justice. Cuba and the Soviet Union
reaffirm their internationalist solidarity with the people of Vietnam. They
will continue to strengthen their fraternal collaboration with the DRV in
restoring its national economy and in building socialism. They condemn the
sabotage of the Paris Agreement and solidarize with the DRV and the PRGRSV,
who demand observance of the said agreement by all signatories.

Cuba and the Soviet Union positively assess the agreement on the
restoration of peace in Laos and again declare their solidarity with the
struggle of the Combodian patriots, states and document signed by Brezhnev
and Fidel. It adds that Cuba and the USSR support the proposals of the
Government of the DPRK for the peaceful democratic reunification of the
country and the demands of the Korean people for the withdrawal of all
foreign troops from South Korea.

Cuba and the Soviet Union hold identical positions in supporting the
national liberation struggle of the Arab peoples against Israeli
aggression. The first steps have been made toward eliminating the dangerous
source of tension existing in the Middle East. Hostilities have ended and
the peace conference has begun in Geneva. So far, these are partial
measures which do not cover all the zones of the conflict.

The Cuban-Soviet joint declaration stresses that in order to make a reality
the radical peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict, it is
essential to insure the security of all states in that zone. This
presupposes the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab
territories occupied in 1967 and insuring the legitimate rights of the Arab
people of Palestine, otherwise, the situation of tension in the Middle East
will not disappear.

Cuba and the USSR point out that they are deeply satisfied to note that the
concerted actions by the socialist community countries lead to ever more
substantial changes toward detente and establishing peaceful collaboration
in Europe. This concerns the interests of the peoples of Europe, of other
continents and of the world's socialist cause. One important common gain of
the socialist states is the final elimination of the blockade of the GDR,
organized by the imperialist forces. The international juridical
recognition of the GDR is an irreversible fact. The recent agreement
between the CSSR and the FRG puts an end to the disgraceful Munich decree.

Cuba and the Soviet Union consider it very important for the cause of world
peach to consummate the European Conference on Security and Cooperation,
which is called upon to lay the strongest foundation for developing
relations of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between all European
states.

That conference should and ought to conclude with the adoption of decisions
capable of directing European developments into a safe channel of peach and
collaboration. In that sense, a concrete case could be the attainment of
definite decisions for reducing armed forces and armaments in Central
Europe, regarding which, negotiations are being held in Vienna. The
Cuba-Soviet declaration says that to insure a lasting peace between all
Asians states would also mark an important advance in consolidating peace
in the world. For that purpose, the Cuban Government understands and
supports the Soviet Union's concern and efforts in its foreign policy in
trying to create a system of collective security in Asia.

The positive change in international relations is taking place in a climate
of continued confrontation between the two social systems, says the
Cuban-Soviet declaration. It adds: The nature of imperialism has not
changed. Aggressive and reactionary forces are still active in the world,
which oppose international detente and advocate further military
preparations, trying to sow distrust and discord among the peoples. Under
the influence of those forces, the practical solution of heated problems is
delayed and obstacles are artificially created in the European Conference
on Security and Cooperation; and, in the Vienna negotiations, conditions
are invented that are nothing else but an attempt to interfere in the
internal affairs of socialist countries In the united States of North
America, the adversaries of detented, the advocates of a return to the cold
war are becoming more active. /Now these advocates are focusing their
efforts on trying to hinder the normalization of Soviet-U.S. relations,
which has already started and which is an important link in the general
process of lessening the danger of war and developing peaceful and equal
cooperation between nations./

Loyal to the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence, Cuba and the
Soviet Union resolutely condemn any attempt of aggressive and reactionary
forces to force mankind to live in a climate of intensified international
tension and on the brink of war.

In the joint declaration signed by Brezhnev and Fidel, Cuba and the USSR
support the principles of equality, respect for sovereignty and
international integrity, renunciation of the use of force or threat of
force in Latin America just as in other regions of the world. Cuba and the
Soviet Union strongly condemn the imperialist policy of interference in the
internal affairs of Latin American nations.

The Soviet Union resolutely demands an end to the economic and political
blockade and other hostile actions being taken against Socialist Cuba. The
USSR reiterates that it considers legitimate and just and completely
supports the demand of the Republic of Cuba for the unconditional
withdrawal of the North American Guantanamo naval base, located on Cuban
territory.

Cuba and the USSR wrathfully condemn the mass terror, persecution and
executions of patriots being carried out by the fascist military junta in
Chile. At the same time, they declare full solidarity with the Chilean
patriots who are fighting against the bloody and reactionary dictatorship.
The Cuban and Soviet peoples, united to al; progressive forces in the
world, demand freedom for Comrade Luis Corvalan and other victims of the
Chilean junta's terror and demand an immediate end to the bloodshed and
arbitrary actions. This temporary setback will not weaken the will of the
Chilean people in their struggle for genuine independence and democracy.

In the joint declaration signed by Brezhnev and Fidel, both countries
welcome the development and strengthening of ties between Latin American
states and the socialist countries.

The document states that the movement of nonalined nations has come to play
an important role in international politics in recent years. Cuba and the
USSR express their gratitude for the anti-imperialist slant characterizing
the policy of nonalined nations and their desire to contribute to the
strengthening of world peace. Cuba and the Soviet Union welcome the
decisions of the Fourth Nonalined Nations Conference held in Algiers.

The Cuban-Soviet declaration expresses solidarity with the peoples of Asia
and Africa and points out that the disgraceful system of colonialism in any
form or manifestation must be abolished once and for all. It affirms that
the peoples of Angola and Mozambique have every right to the solidarity of
all freedom-loving forces in their just struggle for freedom and
independence.

The document adds that it is the duty of all sincere supporters of
democracy and progress to give full support to the struggle of the peoples
of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa against the racist regimes. The young
Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which continues to fight for the strengthening
of its independence, should be given wide international juridical
recognition. Immediately after, the declaration states that Cuba and the
USSR support the termination of the arms race and support general and
complete disarmament, including both nuclear and conventional arms. /The
world disarmament talks are being called upon to play an important role
with regard to this problem. It is now time to prepare to convoke these
talks. Bearing in mind that it has not yet been possible to stop the
nuclear arms race, all nations must commit themselves not to use force in
international relations and to definitely ban nuclear weapons. The Soviet
proposal to this effect has been approved by an overwhelming majority of
the nations at the 27th UN General Assembly./

The communist parties of Cuba and the USSR, and both states, with other
fraternal countries and parties, will continue to make every effort to
attain positive changes in the international situation and to make them
irreversible. The interests of both nations demand that detente should be
consolidated with concrete measures that will develop peaceful, mutually
beneficial cooperation among states.

The Cuban-Soviet friendship is strong and inviolable. The communist parties
of both countries, which are united by commonly held aims and views and
their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and socialist internationalism, will
continue to de everything necessary to deepen cooperation for the benefit
of the peoples of Cuba and the USSR, the socialist community and the cause
of peace and communism, concludes the declaration signed by Leonid
Brezhnev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and Fidel
Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central Committee.
