1.  [Interview with President Fidel Castro by Rafael Daniel during the
Pan-American Games in Havana on 12 August-recorded]

2.  [Text] This afternoon, our Commander in Chief Fidel Castro [corrects
himself] not this afternoon but a moment ago, visited the bowling alley were
the Pan-American bowling games are being held. This is the only sport that is
making its debut during these Pan-American Games. He was interviewed there by
our reporter Rafael Daniel. Let us watch.

3.  [Begin recording] [Daniel] Commander, we would like to know how you see the
development of the games up to today?

4.  [Castro] How have I seen the development of the games?  Very well. Very
well. [repeats] They have been of very good quality. Very interesting. I have
personally seen some competitions and watched others on television. I think
they have been excellent.

5.  [Daniel] What do you think about the number of medals we have received so
far?

6.  [Castro] I believe it has been a good harvest.

7.  [Daniel] Did you personally expect this number of medals from the Cuban
athletes?

8.  [Castro] Well, not as many. I see that the competition is tougher and
tougher. Countries are paying more attention to sports, although they still pay
little attention overall. Unfortunately, there is a long way to go before the
countries pay the attention they should to sports. The day will come. I see
that the Mexicans and Brazilians are paying more attention to sports. This
makes the competition better.

9.  [Daniel] If I asked you to make a prediction about what Cuba could do from
now until the 18th, what would you tell me?

10.  [Castro] Prediction of what? Of medals?

11.  [Daniel] Yes, of medals.

12.  [Castro] Well, the competitions that are awarded the most medals are
coming to an end. Team sports such as volleyball and baseball and others are
still left. Yesterday, I saw the handball game. You know these sports can only
end with one medal. It is (?not) very fair. Some of these competitions last two
weeks. At the end, the winning team gets the title and it is counted as one
gold medal.

13.  Weight-lifting competitions yielded many medals. They set true records.
Rowing and canoeing also yielded many medals. We had some problems with women's
gymnastics because of the athlete who was hurt. Yesterday, we won the 4 X 400
relay. This was unexpected because of the fact that Roberto was injured. I am
truly very pleased. The women's basketball game with the American team was
phenomenal. It was one of the most impressive things I have seen. It was
unexpected because of the history and the records. The Brazilians played well.
They were able to cancel out the two in the first half; Hortencia and the other
one, Paula. They are phenomenal in their accuracy in throwing baskets. They
look as though they have a laser ray straight to the rim.  They have an
outstanding precision. I had never seen such accuracy from any distance, angle,
or direction.

14.  [Daniel] Well, you know that many athletes are watching this interview
through the Pan-American channel. Do you want to say something to the Cuban
athletes who have participated in these Pan- American Games?

15.  [Castro] Well, I imagine that some of them are warming up and training,
and others are talking to relatives [words indistinct] warm greetings with all
the admiration they deserve for what they have done.

16.  [Daniel] Thank you very much, Commander. [end recording]
