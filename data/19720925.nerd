[Text] Havana, 25 Sep--Prime Minister Fidel Castro said this afternoon that
there is an international conspiracy against Chile.

The Cuban leader was questioned by foreign correspondents accredited here
when he arrived at the site of a ceremony to inaugurate a rural secondary
school outside this capital.

He said that the alleged "report" of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
made public by U.S. journalist Jack Anderson was part of a broad publicity
campaign against Chile.

He called the reports of some U.S. news agencies "cheap rumors," which
attempted to show Fidel Castro himself as expressing opinions against
President Allende's methods of government.

In another part of his informal talk with reporters, Fidel Castro said that
Richard Nixon is in his opinion "a demagog and a fake," and that he had
based his conclusion on Nixon's acts, primarily his aggression in Vietnam.
