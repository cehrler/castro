[Text] Havana March 20 TASS--The three-day session of the permanent
coordination committee of non-aligned countries at the level of foreign
ministers closed here. Delegations of the 17 committee member-countries and
observers from many other countries and national liberation movements
adopted decisions directed at stepping up the struggle of the developing
countries against colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism, for peace
and social progress.

The closing meeting of the session was addressed by first secretary of the
Cuban Communist Party Central Committee, Prime Minister of the
Revolutionary Government Fidel Castro. He touched upon a number of
international problems that are of vital significance for all the
developing states of the world.

Noting that imperialism is trying to find a way out of the present economic
crisis at the expense of interests of the developing nations Fidel Castro
pointed to the importance and vital necessity of strengthening unity in the
anti-imperialist struggle.

Historical experience shows, he stressed, that firm unity of peoples and
their determination to give a rebuff to the aggressors are most important
factors making it possible to counter imperialist threats. This was in
particular vividly shown by the Cuban people who emerged victorious in the
struggle against the blockade and aggression thanks to international
solidarity and particularly resolute aid rendered to it by the Soviet
Union.

Fidel Castro noted that the movement of non-aligned countries units a large
number of states with different socio-political system which have shown in
practice the possibility of joint actions.

Fidel Castro characterized in detail the situation in Chile. He wrathfully
condemned the criminal coup staged by the putschists with the support of
imperialism and direct participation of the U.S. CIA and expressed Cuban
people's determined solidarity with the heroic struggle of the Chilean
patriots against the dictatorial regime of the military. Fidel Castro
expressed firm confidence that the people of Chile will overthrow the yoke
of the fascist junta.
