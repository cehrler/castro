[Text] Havana, July 27, TASS--TASS corresponds U. Romantsov and V. Mironov
report:

The people of Cuba celebrated on Sunday their revolutionary holiday--the
day of the national uprising. A grandiose meeting was held on Jose Marti
Square in Havana. The meeting was addressed with a lengthy report by the
first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba,
Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government Fidel Castro. The speaker
warmly welcomed numerous foreign delegations, which were present at the
meeting, among them the Soviet delegation led by K.F. Katushev, secretary
of the CPSU Central Committee.

Fidel Castro paid tribute to the memory of heroes, who stormed 17 years ago
Moncado Barracks. Then he spoke in great detail on the problems of the
economic development of Cuba. The battle on the economic front, he said, is
the most difficult of all battles the the solution of national economic
tasks requires a long time, but we must win this battle and we shall be
able to win it only through the efforts of the entire people without
weakening, in doing so, our vigilance in face of threats and provocations
from the enemies of the Cuban revolution:

The Prime-Minister noted the high class consciousness and revolutionary
enthusiasm of the people of Cuba, which were vividly shown at the first
finished zafra of 1970. As a result of it the country has for the first
time produced over eight and a half million tons of sugar.

Special consciousness towards labour and interests of production was
displayed by the working class. It is in this, said Fidel Castro, that the
practical lesson of Marxism-Leninism consists and the correctness of the
assessment of the proletariat's role is confirmed.

Fidel Castro stressed that after the victory of the revolution every-day
attention has been devoted in the country to the improvement of the living
conditions of the working people. With every passing year the state
allocates increasingly greater funds for the needs of public health
services, education and social maintenance of the population, the
construction of apartment houses, and everyday service facilities.
