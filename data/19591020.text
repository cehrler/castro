Land and Food

And to those who threaten us with refusal to buy our products, we
can say that while there is land, there is food, and that we will establish
world trade, without need to depend on a single market.  We are going to
develop all our economic potential and we will sell products to all the
corners of the world.  Because to top it all, it is claimed that a people
has no relations with the rest of the world, and in addition they threaten
it with refusal to purchase what it produces.

For if we do not rule in our country, why do we need a flag, an
anthem, the title of free country?  And we must ask those who threaten to
oblige us to do what they want if indeed we lack hands?  Because there is
no greater truth than that which says that without economic freedom one
cannot have political freedom.

No Petty Politicking

All that will count here is the voice of the people, and measures
will be adopted when the people say. We are not motiviated by ambition, and
for this reason, we have a clear conscience.  We have to do what was not
done in 50 years.  First, we will resolve the problems of republic, and
then let the politicians come, for they will not deceive even the children.
The future generation will be truly educated.  We are training them for a
better future than this.  Let the politicians resolve to try.  Let him who
aspires to be outstanding try to be the most self-sacrificing and the most
patriotic.  Here we will do what the people want.

They confuse elections with petty politicking.  If we have
elections, certainly we will win them, but what they want is for us to lose
time with politics.  They want to hold back the revolution, divide it,
diminish it.  Our philosophy is to do what the people decide.
