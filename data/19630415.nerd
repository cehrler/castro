CASTRO ADDRESSES BRAZIL-BOUND ATHLETES

Havana in Spanish to the Americas 1800 GMT 15 April 1963--E

(Text) Cuban Premier Maj. Fidel Castro spoke yesterday afternoon with the
athletes preparing for the Fourth Pan American Games to be held in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, beginning 20 April. The Premier and the national director of
sports, physical education, and recreation, Jose Llanusa, visited the Latin
American stadium in Havana, where an exhibition baseball game was taking
place between the players who will represent Cuba in Sao Paulo. Major
Castro pitched one of the innings and Llanusa pitched for the other team.

The Premiere spoke also to some of the other athletes present, boxers,
fencers, and runners. In reference to the maneuvers being staged by
imperialist agents to prevent Cuba from competing in Brazil, the Premier
said that Cuba faithfully observes international spot regulations and that
to try to prevent the Cubans from participating in the competition is an
arbitrary act. Later on he said that the force of reason would prevail.
While speaking to Direct Llanusa, the Premier suggested that peasant girls
under scholarships granted by the Revolutionary Government in the arts and
in secondary and sewing schools be tested. Castro then invited the athletes
present to climb Turquino Peak with him, the highest point in the Sierra
Maestra, a climb considered as a mark of revolutionary strength and
determination.

During his talks, he said that champion Berta Diaz cannot go to the Sao
Paulo because of (illness?) but expressed hope that she would achieve great
victories in the Japanese games.

Speaking to the members of the baseball team selected to go to Brazil,
Fidel Castro said that the baseball players will do well in Sao Paulo and
that the reason for trying to eliminate Cuba from the Pan American Games is
precisely because Cuban baseball is not professional and has quality. In
conclusion, he said: "It seems to me that the North Americans are afraid of
us in Sao Paulo, above all in a place where Cuba, but not them, has so many
supporters. Therefore, they are using many tricks and illegal actions;
however, our athletes will bring back well-earned medals."
