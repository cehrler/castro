1.  [Remarks by President Fidel Castro Ruz to delegates of the 16th Congress of
the Cuban Workers Federation, CTC, gathered at the Karl Marx Theater in Havana
on 25 January--recorded]

2.  [Text] We have placed high hopes in all these things that we are doing,
slowly. It is not a question of doing everything in a hurry.  There is already
a contingent in the area of communications, as the comrade said.  There is
already a contingent in a construction materials enterprise, because one cannot
apply these criteria everywhere.

3.  There are other sectors in which we should also organize contingents.  We
are doing things slowly so everything can be done well.  Now, contingent
workers are the best-fed workers in the country, they are the ones who rest
better or those who rest in better conditions, they receive all kinds of
medical care.  I would say they are among the healthiest people in the country.

4.  What Palmero [head of the Blas Roca Calderio contingent] said reflects some
things I discussed with him, some things that I told him.  There are some
wormoids [gusanoides] out there, some wormoids in some circles who are
ultimately against the revolution, who are hurt by the good things achieved by
the revolution.  These are the ones who complain if there are no houses, or if
there is a shortage of something.  When the country begins to apply measures
and methods to solve a large number of problems, and when we start to work the
way we should, then they begin to fabricate things.  These are people who
generally do not work; these people--who do not work-- are hurt every time the
revolution does something.  If we create family doctors and if this strengthens
the revolution, then the fabrications begin; if we create contingents, then
they start to fabricate things about the contingents, they look for negative
sides to the contingents, as if this effort was not being made by humans.

5.  Do not forget the cost of a revolution, which cost something more than
efforts.  It costs blood; it costs lives.  If the revolution demands that we
sweat, then we ought to be happy, because this is the lowest price we can pay
for a revolution, that is, our sweat.  To defend the revolution we must be
willing to give our lives, the lives of thousands, of tens of thousands, of
tens of millions of human beings.  Those who want the revolution weakened seek
to put the revolution at the mercy of imperialism.  How much would a weakened
revolution cost, that is, if it is ideologically weakened, if it is politically
weakened?  Millions of lives, because a revolution brings so much justice to
the peoples that even it makes many mistakes.  There are always millions of
people prepared to defend it. [applause]
