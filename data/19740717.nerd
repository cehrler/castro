[Text] Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central
Committee, sent a congratulatory message to the members of the 56th
Anniversary of the October Revolution Brigade, which last Wednesday became
the first in the country to cut 10 million arrobas of cane in one harvest.

"Dear comrades of the 56th Anniversary of the October Revolution Brigade: I
have followed very closely the work of that heroic brigade since meeting
with you together with Comrade Boumediene. The news that you have cut 10
million arrobas has produced real admiration," reads the message. "The feat
that has been accomplished, the labor heroism developed throughout long
months in the canefields of the fatherland, have the recognition and
gratitude of all our people."

"As we gradually mechanize the process of cutting cane, men like you, who
grip the mechete with mambi-like determination, insure the fundamental
economic activity of our country. You, courageous combatants of production
who bear the glorious name 56th Anniversary of the October Revolution,
those of the Evelio Rodriguez Curbelo Brigade and those tens of thousands
of brigade members that have cut one million and several million arrobas,
make an exemplary contribution to the creation of wealth for our people, to
the construction of the economic foundation of socialism, and represent the
high moral statute, the revolutionary and indomitable spirit of the working
class and people who are building a new society in the American Continent."
