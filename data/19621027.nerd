TEXT OF FIDEL CASTRO MESSAGE TO U THANT

Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish to Latin America 2130 GMT 27 October
1962--E (OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

(Text) Havana--The following is the text of the communique sent by the
premier of the revolutionary Cuban government, Fidel Castro, to the acting
secretary general of the United Nations, U Thant:

I have received your message of 26 October and I acknowledge your noble
concern.

Cuba is ready to discuss to the extent necessary its differences with the
United States and to do everything within its power in cooperation with the
United Nations to resolve the present crisis, but it rejects outright the
violation of the sovereignty of our country due to the naval blockade, an
act of force and war imposed by the United States against Cuba; and it
equally rejects outright the attempt by the United States to determine the
acts that we have a right to undertake in our country, the type of weapons
it considers proper for our defense, our relations with the USSR, and the
steps of international policy which, within the norms and the laws that
regulate relations between the countries of the world and the principles
that regulate the United Nations, we have a right to take to guarantee our
security and sovereignty.

Cuba victimizes no one, it has not violated any international law and, on
the contrary, it has been the victim of aggressive U.S. acts, such as the
naval blockade; and its rights have been outraged.

The Revolutionary Government of Cuba, would be willing to accept the
commitments that you requested as efforts in favor of peace, as long as, at
the same time the U.S. Government, during the period of the negotiations,
stops its threats and aggressive actions against Cuba, including a naval
blockade of our country.

At the same time, I express to you our willingness to attentively consider
any new suggestion of yours. And, if you think it also useful for the cause
of peace, our government, moved by the common intention of freeing mankind
from the dangers of war, would gladly received you in our country in your
role as U.N. secretary general to deal directly with the present crisis.

The unrestricted respect for the sovereignty of Cuba is the indispensable
framework within which Cuba can contribute with the greatest sincerity,
good faith, and without sparing any effort for the solution of the present
problem, and uniting its efforts to those of all the peoples who are
struggling to save the peace at this moment so dramatic for mankind, and
can do everything requested of it except accept the obligation of being a
victim and of renouncing the rights that are inherent in all sovereign
states.

I reiterate my highest consideration. Maj. Fidel Castro Ruz, premier of the
Revolutionary Government of Cuba.
