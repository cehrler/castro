(Text) Havana--Agreements were signed in Havana on 25 September between the
Soviet Union and the Republic of Cuba on the building of a fishing port in
Cuba with Soviet assistance and on cooperation between Cuba and the Soviet
Union in sea fishing.

The agreements were signed by the premier of the revolutionary government,
Fidel Castro, for the Cuban side, and Chairman of the State Committee for
the Fishing Industry A.A. Ishkov, for the Soviet side.

The agreements provide for Soviet technical assistance for Cuba in
construction of a port, including the building of wharves, freezers,
storage facilities, repair shops with a floating dock oil-storage
facilities, a radio station, and other auxiliary installations. The port
will be designed to accommodate up to 130 fishing ships.

The agreement also provides for mutual consultation on questions of sea
fishing, coordination of fishing research in the Atlantic, and exchange of
experience between Soviet and Cuban fishing organizations.

Fidel Castro made a brief speech at the opening ceremony. He stressed the
tremendous importance of these agreements for development of friendly
relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union and pointed to their mutually
advantageous nature.

We believe, he said, that these agreements will be of tremendous benefit
for Cuba. They will promote the expansion of her fishing fleet and fishing
industry. With Soviet assistance, the Premier said, Cuba will train highly
skilled fishermen.

On behalf of the people and government of Cuba, Castro conveyed gratitude
to the Soviet people and their government for their disinterested
assistance.
