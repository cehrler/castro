Senate Rejects Motion on Castro Statements LD052325 Madrid Domestic Service
in Spanish 2000 GMT 5 Mar 87

[Excerpts] The plenum of the Senate this evening voted on a motion calling
for an institutional statement by the upper house rejecting statements made
by Fidel Castro against Felix Ponz, president of the Spanish Congress.
Antonio Regalado reports:

The motion by the popular group in the Senate calling for the house to
approve an institutional statement expressing its rejection of the
offensive statements made by Fidel Castro with regard to Congress President
Felix Ponz, was rejected by 117 votes to 29. The votes in support were
those of the Popular Alliance, the Popular Democratic Party, and the
Liberal Party. The PSOE, the Nationalists and those of the Mixed Group said
no, supporting the Socialist view that this is a matter which has already
been settled through diplomatic channels. [passage omitted]

As you will recall, Fidel Castro called Ponz a fascist, reactionary little
creep for not inviting the Cuban National Assembly to take part in the
fourth conference of Iberian-American democratic parliaments, held in
Madrid -- an invitation which was also not extended to Paraguay or Chile,
because they do not have pluralist regimes.
