[Text] Havana--Erich Honecker, first secretary of the SED Central Committee
and Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party Central
signed this afternoon in the Palace of the Revolution in Havana a
"declaration on the strengthening of friendship and the deepening of
cooperation between the GDR and the Cuban Republic."

Erich Honecker and Fidel Castro also signed an "agreement on cooperation
between the German SED and the Cuban Communist Party for the years
1974-75." The official negotiations between the two party and government
delegations, which took place in an atmosphere of fraternal unity and
complete unanimity, were concluded before the signing ceremony.

The wood-panelled hall with a Lenin bust at the front was illuminated by
the lights of the camera team, when members of the party and government
delegations headed by Erich Honecker and Fidel Castro lined up before the
flags of the two states.

government agreements and accord on cooperation in the building industry.
Then Erich Honecker and Fidel Castro sat down at the table. They signed the
declaration and the agreement on the cooperation of the two parties. The
exchange of the red folders with the documents was accompanied by applause.
This was followed by a cordial embrace. Then the two first secretaries
firmly shook hands.

Immediately after the signing ceremony, the GDR delegation left for the
