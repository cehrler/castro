Party of Cuba Central Committee and president of the Councils of State and
Ministers, has visited several work collectives in Ciego de Avila
Province.  He also participated in the banner-awarding ceremony of the
Roberto Rodriguez, el Vaquerito, and Heroes of Cuito Cuanavale contingents.

[Unidentified speaker] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of
the PCC Central Committee and president of the Councils of State and
Ministers, has awarded the banner to the contingents Roberto Rodriguez, el
Vaquerito, in charge of building the causeway linking our island with Cayo
Coco, and Heroes of Cuito Cuanavale, in charge of water resource management
projects.

[Castro] The progress made in the construction of the causeway in these
last 2 years is truly extraordinary.  The progress made in the creation of
the plans for the development of-the-key is extraordinary.  There is
already a master plan for the development of the key.  The first camps to
house the ones who are going to build hotels in the key are already being
built.  It is going to be an easy task to take the materials and everything
needed for the construction with the causeway.  Likewise, the camp we just
saw for the first group that is going to work there is an excellent camp.
It has a lunch room that, more than a lunch room, looks like a restaurant.
The kitchen and the area where it serves has tiles.  The shelters are
excellent.  It has excellent warehouses.  Living conditions are already
being created for those who are going to build here.

The key is going to turn into a mine of resources for the country.  The
foreigners who have visited this key have been impressed with the beauty
of the place.  They are going to be even more impressed when they see this
project.  Tourists are also going to like the scenery that one can see
during the trip on the causeway through the ocean a lot.  It was said here
that most of the bridges are already completed.  The drawbridge is at an
advanced stage.  Very little of the bridge's construction needs to be
completed.  The causeway is already beginning to be paved with inverted
penetration.  You can already see the height it has reached.  It withstood
winds, northern storms, and high tides.  We are confident that that
causeway is capable of resisting any test.  If there are difficulties we
can elevate it even more.  We are not concerned over any difficulty.  If a
large hurricane comes and damages the causeway, we will repair it
immediately.  That causeway is extremely useful.  How could the thousands
and thousands of rooms be built there?  How can an entire tourist town be
built without that causeway?  Imagine how it would be to transport
everything by land [corrects himself] by sea and through shallow waters
from there to there.  This is why we can say that our country has become
richer through your efforts.  The national territory has become larger by
over 350 square kilometers thanks to you.  That key was part of our country
but we could not to anything with it.  This causeway was needed. [end

Previously, the chief of the revolution, accompanied by Alfredo Hondal
Gonzalez, member of the PCC Central Committee and first secretary of the
party in the province, toured the projects under construction at the
Chicola dike; the 17-km causeway through the ocean in the northern Cayo
Coco coast, where a strong tourism program is being planned.  La Jaula
camp; a border guard post, and the Ensenada de Bautista, where the
Caribbean Construction Enterprises Union, UNECA, is building a camp that
will house the construction forces of the Cayo Coco tourist program.

[Begin recording] [Castro, at a construction site]  This is a great
project.  What are they doing there?

[First unidentified speaker] [Passage indistinct]

[Castro] [Passage indistinct]

[Second unidentified speaker, in progress]...a group of small beaches and
then there is a large beach called La Jaula, which is a large and very
pretty beach...

[Castro, interrupting] Like this one?

[Second speaker] Yes or even better.  We can go there later.  Then, there
are beaches and more beaches.

[Castro, speaking from podium] We are very pleased to see how well you are
doing.  I am pleased by the enthusiasm.  I am pleased by the health of the
members of the contingents.  I can tell you that you are truly working for
the future.  You are forging the future.  The new generations, the future
generations of our country will always have to recognize you, will always
have to honor you, and will always be proud of you.  We will be able to
tell them the revolutionaries were the ones who made possible the new
fatherland.  Those were the true revolutionaries, not with words but with
deeds. [applause]  This is why it pleases us to be able to hand you those
banners you have won with the heroism of work.  Fatherland or death, we
will win!  [crowd answers:  We will win!] [applause] [end recording]
