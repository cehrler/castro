[Excerpt] Admiral Hesse informed the Cuban guests about the development of
the People's Navy into an efficient force of the National People's Army.
The People's Navy is fulfilling its task in close comradeship in arms with
the Baltic Red Banner Fleet and the Polish Fleet.

Cordial meetings took place aboard the Kyritz between Castro and the
sailors. Afterward Castro made a brief speech to the sailors, NCO's and
officers of the People's Navy, in which he said: "Your task is to fight and
to defeat the enemy. I am certain that the guns are functioning properly as
well as the ships, torpedoes, and rockets. Your fighting force, too, is
functioning at peak performance."

"It is a great honor for us to visit your formation. We have been impressed
by the technical equipment, but what has impressed us most is the way you
are fulfilling your mission. You are aware of the fact that you are facing
the enemy in the frontline. You are aware of the very important role you
play."

Castro went on: "Communist have a long tradition of heroism, of fighting.
It is the revolutionary spirit which makes us superior to our enemies. The
fact that we are communists renders us invincible. We should like to convey
to you the ardent militant greetings of the Cuban Navy and to tell you that
the Navies of the Soviet Union and the other states of the socialist camp
have a firm ally. On the other side of the Atlantic, there also exists a
navy. Small though it is, it is up to date, and its crews likewise, are
communists. You may count on this navy also."
