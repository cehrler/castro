FL1212155088 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1214 GMT 12 Dec 88

[Report by Juan Carlos Roque Garcia during "Haciendo Radio" program]

[Text] Our highest leader, Fidel Castro, has offered some details regarding
the possibilities of planning a work force to develop the country and to
continue the solidary assistance to other brother peoples.

[Begin Castro recording] We must take into account that if the talks
conclude on southern Africa [corrects himself] southwest Africa, thousands
of people will return.  We will have a work force available.

We are making estimates for our plans.  We have some very extensive plans.
We have work to do here and this year we will promote this.  Next year we
will construct the airport.  We will prioritize industrial projects in
1989.  We will prioritize these without neglecting other things, such as
homes and social projects.  However, we will primarily promote industrial
projects that could be advanced.  We will also promote economic projects,
such as hotels for tourism, which are of great importance; or other
projects that could improve our income in convertible currency.

We have great plans. I think that there are people, there are people
[repeats himself] for everything.  There are people to fulfill ambitious
plans and there are people to cooperate in this matter, in construction
there in [words indistinct].

We will also give aid to the Nicaraguans because a hurricane hit their
country.  We have offered construction help in Bluefields.  Bluefields was
devastated.  We plan to help the Nicaraguans in the reconstruction of
Bluefields.

Therefore, we will have two internationalist tasks:  one in Nicaragua and
the other in the Soviet Union.  [end recording]
