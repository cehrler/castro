[Text] In statements given to Montevideo Television Channel 10, Cuban
President Fidel Castro expressed his good feelings for the Uruguayan people
who, he said, have permanently supported the Cuban revolution.

Castro talked about the topic of the Third World's unpayable and
irrecoverable foreign debt and he reiterated his support for Brazil's
decision to suspend interest payments on its foreign debt for an indefinite
period of time.

Castro said that Latin American will make no progress without economic
integration, which he said Cuba is willing to join despite that fact that
it has a different socioeconomic system from the other nations of the area.

Asked by Uruguayan journalists about the reforms promoted by Mikhail
Gorbachev in the USSR, Castro said that the world needed a new approach and
that is precisely what the Soviet leader brought.
