[Text] Havana, Dec 1 (ARP) -- President Fidel Castro of Cuba has asked the
president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch,
to intervene and see that the 1988 Olympic games are held in both South and
North Korea. The Cuban leader considers that this could prevent the Olympic
movement suffering what he calls "an irreversible crisis." In a letter to
Mr Samaranch, President Castro said that holding games in South Korea as
scheduled will "do nothing to promote peace and unite the two Koreas."

Claiming that South Korea was "virtually occupied by American troops and
bases," President Castro said that the Seoul government could "hardly be
considered an example of respect for human rights." These factors would
definitely influence socialist states and be taken into consideration by
non-aligned and Third World nations when it came to participating, he said.

The Cuban leader did not specify whether his country would stay away from
the games if they went ahead only in Seoul. Cuba boycotted the Los Angeles
Olympics in the summer along with most other communist countries.
