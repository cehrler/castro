Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 1030 GMT 9 July 74 F

[Text] Our Commander in Chief Fidel Castro held a lively meeting with the
outstanding pioneers in the country gathered at the 6 July camporee held at
Lenin park, which was dedicated last Saturday, National Children's Day.
Fidel as bestowed the 4 April decoration, which was pinned on him by
Pioneer Susana Ojeda Fernandez, of the Nene Traviesa school of Ciudad
Libertad.

Fidel addressed the children from an improvised platform, thanking them for
the highest Pioneer award.

"For me" he said, "It is a truly moving gesture which stirs my will, desire
and determination to keep working and struggling alongside all the people
so our country can press forward, so our young people can develop, so our
children can grow and be educated and so the future generations will each
have an evermore splendid and happy land."

Fidel said: "The Union of Cuban Pioneers [UPC] is a great school in which
children prepare for the future. Your revolutionary life begins in the UPC.
I feel certain that there is not a single one of you that does not want to
be a revolutionary, a future communist. And I am just as sure that in your
hearts you harbor the hope of belonging to our Communist Party tomorrow.

Fidel said: "In many countries, tens of millions of children do not have
the opportunity to attend school, study and continue struggling for
humanity's future. Justice has not reached them yet, but it will come to
all the countries sooner or later."

After noting the possibilities that all the children in our country enjoy
for studying, Fidel added: "In the future there can be no talk of
illiterates, since everyone will not only know how to read and write, but
also receive a splendid education."

He added: "When you are adults, you will life in a society that is more
cultured, more educated and have less needs than the society of the
present. Yet, you must prepare yourselves for that life. We must all
struggle for that future. That is of the essence and one of the most
important goals of the Pioneers' organization. We will all keep working and
struggling for the Pioneers."

Fidel stressed the need to establish UPC palaces in all the country's
provinces. He also stressed the importance of the school farms that are
being developed everywhere in the country.

Fidel cited what was say by young Pioneer girl--that the Pioneers would
forthrightly grasps the flags of the revolution and keep building the
country's future. He added: "We trust our Pioneers, fully confident that
they will be capable of building the future of our fatherland, just as well
feel you will know how to set the example of everything."

Together with the children, our commander in chief pointed to the
inconvenience of holding National Children's Day on 6 July. On a suggestion
from the Pioneers, it was agreed to recommend to the party and the
government that the commeroration of that day be changed to the third
Sunday in July.
