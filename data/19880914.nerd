[Message from President Fidel Castro to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
on Nicaragua's independence day--date not given]

[Text] Upon our commemoration of the 167th anniversary of Nicaragua's
independence from Spanish colonialism, I take pleasure in expressing to
you, on behalf of the Cuban people and government, our most sincere
congratulations.

Central America became independent from the Spanish crown in 1821; however,
U.S. neocolonialism prevented these nations from achieving true
independence.  Imperialism tried to preserve the old and obsolete
mechanisms of exploitation and to silence the new and continuous cries for
freedom.

However, once more the best children of the Central American land, heirs to
the historic legacy of their leaders in the independence struggle, are
holding high the banners of the struggle against national oppression and
imperialism.

Nicaragua today embodies these ideals and heroically defends them.  The
firm peace policy that the Sandinist revolution has developed has earned it
support and respect in the international arena while most Latin American
governments have made major efforts to promote a just and negotiated
solution to the Central American crisis.

The Cuban people and government feel that this anniversary is a fitting
occasion to reiterate to the heroic Nicaraguan people our determination to
continue offering our selfless cooperation and strong support to all
efforts aimed at safeguarding your independence, sovereignty, and
territorial integrity and at the same time to wish you more victories in
the construction of a new Nicaragua.

Receive, my dear comrade, our strong revolutionary embrace.

[Signed] Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Cuban Council of State and
Government
