1.  [Interview with Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Communist Party of
Cuba, by special correspondent Spiros Markandonis-place, date not given]

2.  [Text] [Markandonis] Before the attack against the Moncada military
barracks on 16 July 1953 you told your comrades: ``In a few hours we will win
or we will be defeated, but in any case, listen good comrades, this movement
will triumph.  If we win today, we will realize Marti's dream early; if not,
this action will be used as an example for the Cuban people to raise the banner
and go forward.''

3.  You won and other people won, but today the others are retreating.  What
will Cuba do now that the former European socialist countries and the USSR have
changed their foreign and economic policies toward Cuba?

4.  [Castro] I can tell you that throughout the history of the revolution we
have passed through very hard times, some of them even harder than now, and we
intend to stand firm and resist.  We will not surrender before the obstacles
and difficulties created by the retreat of the other European socialist
countries or the vanishing of the USSR.  We have enough courage to go forward
and we will continue to defend our cause because we believe it is the most
right and we are convinced that, as in the past, we will emerge victorious.
Please convey to the KKE [Greek Communist Party] comrades our gratitude,
brotherly greetings, and my wishes that they will not be discouraged by the
difficult times.  When times are hard revolutionaries must augment their
courage and activity.  My regards to all.
