FULL TEXT OF ARTICLE:
1.  [Text] Simon Bolivar, the liberator, came to Havana for a two-day visit on
a day like this one, 192 years ago. This historic visit has been commemorated
with a very noble and beautiful ceremony. Commander in Chief Fidel Castro,
president of the Councils of State and Ministers, participated in placing a
plaque and time capsule at the Simon Bolivar House, which is to be restored in
the heart of Old Havana as a reminder of Bolivar's visit to our city and the
validity of his Latin American thinking.

2.  Bolivar, who so loved the liberty of Latin America and spared no sacrifice
to obtain it, wanted more than anything else to see Latin America become the
greatest nation in the world. The renovation of this house that will be named
after him opens a new opportunity to turn our city into a Latin American
cultural center.

3.  [Begin recording] [Reporter Estrella Fermillo] You have read Marti's and
Bolivar's writings extensively. They advocated Latin American unity so much. To
what extent are we alone, while our Latin American brothers are so close?

4.  [Castro] All of you always repeat the same question. The other day in a
ceremony at El Paraiso another comrade asked me a similar question about being
alone. We have never had so much company. We are alone, we could say, at the
top. [laughs] We are alone on the highest, highest, highest peak, but we are in
the company of Latin Americans. Especially since of all of our revolutionary
history we now have the best relations. There are some exceptions--there always
are, as is natural--but never before have there been so many ties, so many
relations between us and Latin Americans. As I mentioned the other day to some
students, there is a growing consciousness, as the Venezuelan historian also
mentioned, of the dangers of today's world. This makes us closer, unite, and at
least from Latin America, we are receiving many indications of support, from
all over, and they hope that we will be capable of rising to the challenge of
this moment.

5.  [Fermillo] And to what extent ....

6.  [Castro, interrupting] You said one question, and this one makes two.
[laughter] Why do you not speak with Morela and ask her one? [laughter]

7.  [Fermillo] And to what extent is Bolivar's thinking still valid in these
turbulent times?

8.  [Castro] Well, more than ever, more than ever, Bolivar's and Marti's; their
thinking was very similar. We are now suffering the consequences of not having
united before.  That is why their thinking is extraordinarily valid, even more
than in their own era. Marti had already set forth that concept; they both say
the same thing. Bolivar stated the idea that we seem to be plagued in the name
of the United States with ....[rephrases] What was that phrase he used with
respect to Latin America?

9.  [Unidentified speaker] The American hemisphere in the name of liberty.

10.  [Castro] Yes, yes, in the name of liberty. Likewise, Marti said that
everything he had done, and would do, was meant to prevent, through Cuba's
independence, the United States from falling upon the Latin American nations as
one more power. Both ideas are very kindred but particularly today, at this
specific juncture, they are more valid than ever. Ask Morelia, Morela [corrects
himself]. It is not Morelia; Morelia is a state in Mexico.  She is Morela.

11.  [Morela] All I want to say is that Bolivar is what brings us together
today. That is all.

12.  [Castro] And Marti.

13.  [Morela] And Marti.

14.  [Castro] Marti was born nearby, very close to this place where we stand.
Both houses are close, Bolivar's house and Marti's house. [end recording]

15.  After the ceremony, Venezuelan mezzo-soprano Morela Munoz offered a
beautiful concert of Latin American and South American Indian songs.
