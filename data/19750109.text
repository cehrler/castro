[Text] Mexico, 9 Jan--Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro told a group of
Mexican journalists visiting Havana that the world's economic crisis will
undoubtedly speed up the revolutionary process. During the interview Castro
pointed out that the same crisis will bring great suffering to millions of
human beings.

"So far, this crisis has been checked. I do not know how, but it could run
wild, and it will be the worst one of all," Castro added, according to the
Mexican press report.

Referring to the conflict between China and the USSR, Castro said it lacks
objectivity. Referring to the Organization of American States, the Cuban
Prime Minister described it as "the U.S. ministry of colonies," and added:
"it is our enemy."

Asked about his opinion of the United States, Castro said "they have too
many problems to continue playing the blockade game." He added, "15 years
ago they were very powerful, but today they are not so powerful."
