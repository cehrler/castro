[Excerpt] Havana, 24 Jul (AFP)--Foreign visitors ask why perestroyka has
not reached Cuba and they get a response:  It is a Soviet remedy for Soviet
ills and Cuba has its own medicine:  the process of rectification of
errors.

President Fidel Castro has issued the prescription:  The Cuban
revolution "is not obligated to copy anything from anybody," and since it
is at the doors of "imperialism," is cannot committ "strategic errors" such
as "using capitalist methods" in socialism.  According to the Cuban leader,
"problems must also be resolved with honor, morals, and principles."

According to a formula of the late Ernesto  Che Guercara, which was
reinstated as a basis of the process of rectification of errors, the human
being "is not only moved by economic elements; his communist awareness must
also be stimulated." [passage omitted]
