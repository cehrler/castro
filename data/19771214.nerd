[Text] Mrs Beverly Manley, president of the Women's Movement of the Jamaica
People's National Party and wife of Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley,
today returned to her country.   At the air terminal to bid farewell to the
visitor were Dora Carcano, secretary general of the Federation of Cuban
Women and alternate member of the PCC Central Committee, and Ulises
Estrada, deputy chief of the Central Committee Americs Department.

Prior to her departure, Beverly Manley gave a press conference in which she
reported on some matters related to the activities of the Women's Movement
in Jamica.  Mrs Manley indicated that her organization has set as its main
goal the eradication of problems created by imperialism, especially the low
level of development existing among women.  She added that her organization
is striving to increase the level of awareness of women in political,
economic, social and ideological matters.  Mrs Manley also referred to the
creation of new laws which will benefit women in the country.

[Kingston Domestic Service in English at 1730 GMT on 13 December reports
that Mrs Manley "returned to the island this afternoon from Cuba following
a 4-day visit to that country.  She should have returned this morning
but her flight was delayed."]
