PRIORITY

Prime Minister Castro in speech before congress of Sugar Workers Federation
(FNTA) December 15 heavily emphasized threat to revolution posed by
counter-revolutionaries at home and abroad.  Said there is real and present
danger of invasion by foreign forces.  Bitterly attacked "reactionary
press" with special emphasis on MARINA and AVANCE.  Cenrado Becquer in
speech opening meeting said that if United States reduces quota FNTA
supported by its 500,000 members will demand revolutionary government
nationalize the industry.

Castro's speech was in now familiar vein.  Said great sacrifices have been
made and greater ones may be called for.  Repeatedly returned to them that
revolution surrounded by enemies and persecuted by foreign interests.  Ton
militant throughout.  Becquer's reference to nationalization was in line
with rumors heard here recently that his ultimate objective.
