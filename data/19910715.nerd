1.  [Report by Diego Mendez during ``Exclusivo'' program-live]

2.  [Text] [Arredondo] This afternoon at the Council of State, our Commander in
Chief Fidel Castro presented the flag to the delegation that will represent
Cuba at the 11th Pan-American Games. Diego Mendez has more information. Diego?

3.  [Mendez] Thank you Cesar [Arredondo, host of ``Exclusivo'' program],
greetings to Radio Rebelde's ``Exclusivo,'' to Cuba, and our America. Indeed,
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has presented the flag to the Cuban delegation
which will participate in the 11th Pan-American Games from 2 to 18 August.
During a solemn ceremony held on the steps of the Palace of the Revolution, the
first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Central Committee received the
national flag from Aurelia Pinzon, glory of Cuban sports. He then placed it in
the hands of Orestes Qindelan, who will be the flag bearer at the sports event.
Elvis Gregory, world champion in men's fencing, read the pledge of the 632
athletes who compose the Cuban delegation.

4.  Later, Fidel spoke to the members of the Cuban delegation and urged them to
be an example of the courage and valor of our people. He also stressed that we
should fight to get the medal of hospitality and camaraderie with all our
brothers of America. Fidel placed special emphasis on this. I believe it will
be another obvious success for our people, who have always been characterized
by these traits and who will once again display the friendship and fellowship
that unites them with all the peoples of America. It was a lovely ceremony.
After addressing the athletes, Fidel chatted with them. Everything ended with
happiness and a great deal of praise for these athletes who will have the great
responsibility of defending and honorably representing the flag that was handed
to them today.
