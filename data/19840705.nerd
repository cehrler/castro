FL051859 Havana Television Service in Spanish 1700 GMT 5 Jul 84

[Excepts] With Fidel Castro, president of the Councils of State and
Ministers, in attendance, the 6th regular session of the 2d legislature of
the People's Government National Assembly [ANPP] opened this morning. At
exactly 0900 on the dot, ANPP President Flavio Bravo declared the session
open, with 93.8 percent attendance.

Present during the morning session were Pedro Pires, adjunct secretary
general of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde, and a
delegation of Mexican legislators. After ratifying the actions of the
previous session, the delegates were informed of all decree laws approved
by the Council of State since the previous session.

Adolfo Valdivia, chairman of the Health Committee, read a report on
institutional care of the aged. The report was approved by the assembly.
Later, the commander in chief gave a special speech:

[Begin Castro recording] We are talking about 751,000 people who are over
65. Well, we have also been concerned about the children, about children's
centers -- we have established hundreds of centers; schools, we have set up
thousands of schools; we have trained teachers and teachers -- more than
200,000 in the years since the revolution. We have been concerned about
health and about many things.

But there really has not been an awareness of this problem, this new need
which is becoming more and important a social need -- and it is a big need.
And little has been done about it. That is the truth. Therefore, it seems
important to me that this report be brought to this National Assembly so
that we become aware and concerned about this serious problem. Moreover, it
is a large problem. [end recording]
