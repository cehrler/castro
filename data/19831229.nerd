[Excerpts] After the conclusion of the gala ceremony at the modern Haydee
Santamaria Publishing House and Printing Plant, Commander in Chief Fidel
Castro made an interesting tour of the city of Palma Soriano beginning at
the house where Sonia Rodriguez Cardona, a former fighter in the Rebel Army
and currently an alternate member of the Central Committee and a deputy to
the People's Government National Assembly, lived.

During the visit, which the people of Palma Soriano enthusiastically
supported with cheers for Fidel and the revolution, our leader was
accompanied by Jose Ramon Balaguer Cabrera, member of the Central Committee
and first secretary of the party in the province, and Emilio Conde Perez,
first secretary of the muncipality, and other leaders of the party and the
government.

Once inside the house, located at 109 16th Street, the president of the
Councils of State and Ministers expressed the need for the municipality of
Palma Soriano to achieve a higher degree of social and economic development
in accordance with the population growth of the past few years.

He also pointed out the need to expand specialized ambulance service for
the rapid transportation of seriously ill people, since adult medical
attention is only available at the (Ambrosio Brillo) Hospital located 22 km
away on the Central Highway in the direction of Santiago de Cuba.

Later, after traveling along Marti Avenue, the main artery of the city,
Fidel left Palma leaving a permanent memory with all those who saw him and
cheered him the same way they did 25 years ago.
