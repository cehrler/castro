[Text] Havana, August 5 TASS -- PRENSA LATINA informs:

Cuban President Fidel Castro has expressed his willingness to debate the
foreign debt problem at meetings including the U.S. and the Chilean and
Paraguayan dictatorships.

It is no Problem for me, he told some 300 reporters who covered a five-day
meeting on Latin American and the Caribbean foreign debt closed at the
International Conference Centre here yesterday.

He spoke of Proposals made by the presidents of Argentina, Peru and Ecuador
for holding a meeting of heads of state and government to examine the
region's foreign debt problems and said no country should be excluded from
it.

He attached great importance to the forthcoming meeting of the Latin
American Parliament in Uruguay but said he had not thought of the
inconvenience of attending it.

I must be discreet because the CIA is following all my movements to carry
out its attacks, Particularly now when Washington is angry because of
Cuba's role in making the Latin Americans aware of the debt problem.

Commenting on the CIA, he said it had been involved in an operation
including some reporters from the U.S.  T.V., whom he charged with
conducting intelligence operations against Cuba.  I know everything, said
the Cuban leader who disclosed details of e journalists' movements to
confirm the alleged presence here of U.S. millionaire Robert Vesco who is
wanted for evading to pay taxes in his country.  Regarding this Fidel
Castro said that members of the U.S. interest office dedicated to
intelligence activities against Cuba gave information to the mentioned
reporters. In opinion of the Cuban leader, it seemed the action was meant
to draw attention away from the foreign debt meeting being held here.

Fidel Castro said he understood why the Mexican Government did not send an
official delegation in a gesture which he described as "prudent and
cautious" because of Mexico's difficult and serious economic situation and
with a neighbor such as the United States which is very concerned on this
meeting.

Fidel Castro praised the democratization process in Brazil, he said the
ties with Colombia were good and that Havana has been clear and honest in
announcing its willingness to help Peru in fulfilling the promises in
favor of the Peruvian people.  There has been a lot of rhetoric in this
continent and we expect words to become a reality.

Fidel Castro also said Cuba had the merit of making the U.S.  "Monroe
Doctrine", claiming Washington's right to militarily intervene against any
country of the continent, fail.  President Ronald Reagan's doctrine is even
worse, but the Nicaraguans with their heroism. will also make it fail, he
stressed.
