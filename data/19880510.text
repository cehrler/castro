[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro sent a message with Rodolfo Puentes
Ferro, member of the PCC Central Committee, to Colonel Denis
Sassou-Nguesso, president of the People's Republic of the Congo.

The exact text of the message has not been revealed, but according to Cuban
sources in Brazzaville it reportedly refers to bilateral relations.  It is
also said to contain the conclusions reached at the quadripartite meeting
recently held in London among the joint Cuban-Angolan delegation and the
United States and South Africa on the situation in southern Africa.

Western press agencies are speculating on another quadripartite meeting on
the same subject this Thursday in Brazzaville, which was denied by South
Africa's Foreign Ministry.
