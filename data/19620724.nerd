(Text) Santiago, Cuba--Fidel Castro declared today that there is no
socialism, no communism without education; there is no work more productive
than teaching" in concluding the ceremonies at the Oriente Theater in this
city honoring the first Frank Pais brigade of the vanguard of volunteer
teachers. Castro, who had come to the capital of this eastern province and
toured various parts of Santiago, emphasized that the work of the vanguard
teachers "is decisive in advancing learning in the more remote regions of
the country."

After saluting the vanguard teachers, the prime minister referred to the
importance to the country of agricultural growth and emphasized the support
given by the students to the volunteer work in connection with the coffee
harvest. Fidel Castro also referred to the peasant-worker alliance and its
importance to the progress of the revolution. He mentioned the
revolutionary attitude of the Sierra Maestra peasants and pointed out that
"many of them spent several months in the Escambray mountains without
seeing their loved ones, firm in their posts, close to the revolution."

He then referred to "the country's sacrifice of its most exemplary sons to
achieve the conquests and the rights which the triumph of the revolution
had brought with it." He emphasized that "the present years are years of
sacrifice" which will permit the future to harvest the fruits of the
efforts made in the construction of socialism.

Fidel Castro declared his conviction that "the comrade teachers of the
vanguard will work hard and comply with their duties."

The presence of the prime minister at the ceremonies in Oriente Theater
where he was accompanied by Maj. Armando Acosta, secretary general of the
provincial ORI, was greeted by the public with hearty applause and cheers
for the Cuban socialist revolution.
