1.  [Remarks by Cuban President Fidel Castro at the Cuban Olympic delegation
flag ceremony in Havana on 25 Jun-recorded]

2.  [Text] First of all I will not be giving a speech. There will be no speech
here. I would just like to say a few words.  We arrived a little late and we
ask that you forgive us.  Fernando [not further identified] insisted that I be
present for the awarding of the flag, but I had a meeting.  I had to wait a
little while and that is why I am late.

3.  After having listened to the oath you have taken...  [pauses] I believe
that there have been two occasions when we did not attend the Olympic games. On
those occasions it was because of dignity and honor. We are now going to
participate in the next Olympic games, but we will attend with great dignity
and great honor.

4.  It seems difficult to surpass the heroic deeds you achieved in the last
Pan-American games. Perhaps even we ourselves did not expect that in the end we
would win approximately 140 gold medals and that we were going to surpass our
neighbors to the north. I believe you have written unforgettable pages in the
sports history of our country.

5.  You will now be participating in the Barcelona Olympics. I believe you will
compete with great dignity, with great fervor, and that you will do your best.
[Baseball player Omar] Linares said that you would be among the top ten. Well,
that is an easy goal. I hope that you do better than your goal so that you
might be among the top nine, or if possible, the top eight. If you can, among
the top seven. Of course this is if you can. It does not need to be a
commitment. I am sure you will do your best.

6.  At that moment of struggle and effort, remember that you are representing
Cuba, the revolution, loyalty to our ideas and principles, and that you are
representing one of the worthiest, most courageous people on earth. That is why
I know that even though you will meet strong competitors, you will bring home
medals for Cuba. You will occupy a position of honor and our people will have
reason to feel proud of their athletes once again.

7.  Socialism or death; fatherland or death; We will win!
