FL020547 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 2 Dec 86

[Excerpt] Acknowledging the principal problems we should confront in the
rectification process, which has been initiated by the party and Fidel, the
deferred session of the Third Communist Party of Cuba Congress continues
its tasks in the Palace of Conventions. The congress is presided over by
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro.

The debates continue to be critical and profound and stress the problems
that confront education and other economic and social areas in the country.
Upon speaking on the need to increase agricultural production, Fidel said:

[Begin Castro recording] Despite the difficulties caused by the drought,
one must require work from agriculture. To make demands on agriculture is
also to make demands on the party. The ANAP [National Association of Small
Farmers] has to make efforts in every province, every municipality in the
areas of the recovery of banana plantations, planting, and other
requirements. We have to make requirements of the ANAP and the peasants.
They used to plant... [does not finish sentence].

They were asked: What are you doing? Some continued planting [words
indistinct]. They said no to planting sugarcane. They removed the sugarcane
and the fertilizer was used for planting garlic or malanga or something
else for money or they [words indistinct]. Requirements must be made for
them. [end Castro recording]
