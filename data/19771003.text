[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central
Committee and president of the Council of State, made the closing speech at
the Havana City Province PCC meeting held yesterday at the Manuel Ascunce
Domenech Theater in Cuidad Escolar Libertad to assess party work and renew
or ratify party mandates in the province of Havana City.  Army Gen Raul
Castro, second secretary of the PCC and first vice president of the Council
of State, Politburo members Ramiro Valdes, Blas Roca, Osvaldo Dorticos,
Sergio de Valle and Mose R. Machado Ventura; Secretariat members Antonio
Perez Herrero and Raul Garcia Pelaez; Jaime Crombet, PCC first secretary
in Havana City; and other members of the Central Committee and provincial
PCC Committee also presided over the meeting.

In his closing remarks, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro referred to the
work which the party has to do in the province to solve such different
difficult and complex problems as water supply, housing construction, the
struggle against crimes and antisocial elements, raising education quality
and improving public health services to perfection.

Fidel also emphasized the work being done to help solve the transportation
problem which is more acute in the capital.  He said that since 1959,
demand for transportation has tripled as a result of the growth of the
Havana City population, but the number of buses has not been increased in
the same proportion.
