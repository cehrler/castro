[Text] On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the
Youth Labor Army, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro sent a message to the
organization in which he points out the highly satisfactory work developed
by it in its first year of existence.

Part of Fidel's message reads as follows: We wish to express our
revolution's pride in having in the YLA a fighting vanguard, a firm
foundation of socialist construction and a strong shield that is always
ready to defend the fatherland. We are well aware that no task will be
impossible to the YLA. Guided by the revolutionary goals that inspire them,
its members and command cadres will heroically fulfill their assignments.

Div Cdr Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, also sent
a congratulatory message to the members of the YLA in which he urges them
to maintain the same spirit and enthusiasm demonstrated heretofore in
attaining new objectives, and reiterates his trust and confidence in that
this army will become a true bulwark of the production and defense of the
revolution.

The main event marking the first anniversary of the founding of the YLA was
held at the Lazarc Pena auditorium of the Central Organization of Cuban
Workers building. Brig Cdr Oscar Fernandez Mell, vice minister-chief of the
YLA, delivered the main address. Luis Orlando Dominguez, first secretary of
the Union of Young Communists, also spoke at the event.
